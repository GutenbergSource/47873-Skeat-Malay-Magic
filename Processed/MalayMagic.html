<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The circumstances attending the composition and publication of the present work have
thrown upon me the duty of furnishing it with a preface explaining its object and
scope.
</p>
<p>Briefly, the purpose of the author has been to collect into a Book of Malay Folklore
all that seemed to him most typical of the subject amongst a considerable mass of
materials, some of which lay scattered in the pages of various other works, others
in unpublished native manuscripts, and much in notes made by him personally of what
he had observed during several years spent in the Malay Peninsula, principally in
the State of Selangor. The book does not profess to be an exhaustive or complete treatise,
but rather, as its title indicates, an introduction to the study of Folklore, Popular
Religion, and Magic as understood among the Malays of the Peninsula.
</p>
<p>It should be superfluous, at this time of day, to defend such studies as these from
the criticisms which have from time to time been brought against them. I remember
my old friend and former teacher, Wan <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e220">[<a href="#xd32e220">viii</a>]</span>ʿAbdullah, a Singapore Malay of Trengganu extraction and Arab descent, a devout and
learned Muhammadan and a most charming man, objecting to them on the grounds, first,
that they were useless, and, secondly, which, as he emphatically declared, was far
worse, that they were perilous to the soul’s health. This last is a point of view
which it would hardly be appropriate or profitable to discuss here, but a few words
may as well be devoted to the other objection. It is based, sometimes, on the ground
that these studies deal not with “facts,” but with mere nonsensical fancies and beliefs.
Now, for facts we all, of course, have the greatest respect; but the objection appears
to me to involve an unwarrantable restriction of the meaning of the word: a belief
which is actually held, even a mere fancy that is entertained in the mind, has a real
existence, and is a fact just as much as any other. As a piece of psychology it must
always have a certain interest, and it may on occasions become of enormous practical
importance. If, for instance, in 1857 certain persons, whose concern it was, had paid
more attention to facts of this kind, possibly the Indian Mutiny could have been prevented,
and probably it might have been foreseen, so that precautionary measures could have
been taken in time to minimise the extent of the catastrophe. It is not suggested
that the matters dealt with in this book are ever likely to involve such serious issues;
but, speaking generally, there can be no doubt <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e222">[<a href="#xd32e222">ix</a>]</span>that an understanding of the ideas and modes of thought of an alien people in a relatively
low stage of civilisation facilitates very considerably the task of governing them;
and in the Malay Peninsula that task has now devolved mainly upon Englishmen. Moreover,
every notion of utility implies an end to which it is to be referred, and there are
other ends in life worth considering as well as those to which the “practical man”
is pleased to restrict himself. When one passes from the practical to the speculative
point of view, it is almost impossible to predict what piece of knowledge will be
fruitful of results, and what will not; <i lang="la">prima facie</i>, therefore, all knowledge has a claim to be considered of importance from a scientific
point of view, and until everything is known, nothing can safely be rejected as worthless.
</p>
<p>Another and more serious objection, aimed rather at the method of such investigations
as these, is that the evidence with which they have to be content is worth little
or nothing. Objectors attempt to discredit it by implying that at best it is only
what A. says that B. told him about the beliefs B. says he holds, in other words,
that it is the merest hearsay; and it is also sometimes suggested that when A. is
a European and B. a savage, or at most a semi-civilised person of another breed, the
chances are that B. will lie about his alleged beliefs, or that A. will unconsciously
read his own ideas into B.’s <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e229">[<a href="#xd32e229">x</a>]</span>confused statements, or that, at any rate, one way or another, they are sure to misunderstand
each other, and accordingly the record cannot be a faithful one.
</p>
<p>So far as this objection can have any application to the present work, it may fairly
be replied: first that the author has been at some pains to corroborate and illustrate
his own accounts by the independent observations of others (and this must be his justification
for the copiousness of his quotations from other writers); and, secondly, that he
has, whenever possible, given us what is really the best kind of evidence for his
own statements by recording the charms and other magic formulæ which are actually
in use. Of these a great number has been here collected, and in the translation of
such of the more interesting ones as are quoted in the text of the book, every effort
has been made to keep to literal accuracy of rendering. The originals will be found
in the Appendix, and it must be left to those who can read Malay to check the author’s
versions, and to draw from the untranslated portions such inferences as may seem to
them good.
</p>
<p>The author himself has no preconceived thesis to maintain: his object has been collection
rather than comparison, and quite apart from the necessary limitations of space and
time, his method has confined the book within fairly well-defined bounds. Though the
subject is one which would naturally lend itself to a comparative treatment, and though
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e234">[<a href="#xd32e234">xi</a>]</span>the comparison of Malay folklore with that of other nations (more particularly of
India, Arabia, and the mainland of Indo-China) would no doubt lead to very interesting
results, the scope of the work has as far as possible been restricted to the folklore
of the Malays of the Peninsula. Accordingly the analogous and often quite similar
customs and ideas of the Malayan races of the Eastern Archipelago have been only occasionally
referred to, while those of the Chinese and other non-Malayan inhabitants of the Peninsula
have been excluded altogether.
</p>
<p>Moreover, several important departments of custom and social life have been, no doubt
designedly, omitted: thus, to mention only one subject out of several that will probably
occur to the reader, the modes of organisation of the Family and the Clan (which in
certain Malay communities present archaic features of no common interest), together
with the derivative notions affecting the tenure and inheritance of property, have
found no place in this work. The field, in fact, is very wide and cannot all be worked
at once. The folklore of uncivilised races may fairly enough be said to embrace every
phase of nature and every department of life: it may be regarded as containing, in
the germ and as yet undifferentiated, the notions from which Religion, Law, Medicine,
Philosophy, Natural Science, and Social Customs are eventually evolved. Its bulk and
relative importance seem to vary inversely with the <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e238">[<a href="#xd32e238">xii</a>]</span>advance of a race in the progress towards civilisation; and the ideas of savages on
these matters appear to constitute in some cases a great and complex system, of which
comparatively few traces only are left among the more civilised peoples. The Malay
race, while far removed from the savage condition, has not as yet reached a very high
stage of civilisation, and still retains relatively large remnants of this primitive
order of ideas. It is true that Malay notions on these subjects are undergoing a process
of disintegration, the rapidity of which has been considerably increased by contact
with European civilisation, but, such as they are, these ideas still form a great
factor in the life of the mass of the people.
</p>
<p>It may, however, be desirable to point out that the complexity of Malay folklore is
to be attributed in part to its singularly mixed character. The development of the
race from savagery and barbarism up to its present condition of comparative civilisation
has been modified and determined, first and most deeply by Indian, and during the
last five centuries or so by Arabian influences. Just as in the language of the Malays
it is possible by analysis to pick out words of Sanskrit and Arabic origin from amongst
the main body of genuinely native words, so in their folklore one finds Hindu, Buddhist,
and Muhammadan ideas overlying a mass of apparently original Malay notions.
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e242">[<a href="#xd32e242">xiii</a>]</span></p>
<p>These various elements of their folklore are, however, now so thoroughly mixed up
together that it is often almost impossible to disentangle them. No systematic attempt
has been made to do so in this book, although here and there an indication of the
origin of some particular myth will be found; but a complete analysis (if possible
at all) would have necessitated, as a preliminary investigation, a much deeper study
of Hindu and Muhammadan mythology than it has been found practicable to engage in.
</p>
<p>In order, however, to give a clear notion of the relation which the beliefs and practices
that are here recorded bear to the official religion of the people, it is necessary
to state that the Malays of the Peninsula are Sunni Muhammadans of the school of Shafi’i,
and that nothing, theoretically speaking, could be more correct and orthodox (from
the point of view of Islām) than the belief which they profess.
</p>
<p>But the beliefs which they actually hold are another matter altogether, and it must
be admitted that the Muhammadan veneer which covers their ancient superstitions is
very often of the thinnest description. The inconsistency in which this involves them
is not, however, as a rule realised by themselves. Beginning their invocations with
the orthodox preface: “<i>In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate</i>,” and ending them with an appeal to the Creed: “<i>There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the Apostle of God</i>,” they are conscious <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e252">[<a href="#xd32e252">xiv</a>]</span>of no impropriety in addressing the intervening matter to a string of Hindu Divinities,
Demons, Ghosts, and Nature Spirits, with a few Angels and Prophets thrown in, as the
occasion may seem to require. Still, the more highly educated Malays, especially those
who live in the towns and come into direct contact with Arab teachers of religion,
are disposed to object strongly to these “relics of paganism”; and there can be no
doubt that the increasing diffusion of general education in the Peninsula is contributing
to the growth of a stricter conception of Islām, which will involve the gradual suppression
of such of these old-world superstitions as are obviously of an “unorthodox” character.
</p>
<p>This process, however, will take several generations to accomplish, and in the meantime
it is to be hoped that a complete record will have been made both of what is doomed
sooner or later to perish, and of what in all likelihood will survive under the new
conditions of our time. It is as a contribution to such a record, and as a collection
of materials to serve as a sound basis for further additions and comparisons, that
this work is offered to the reader.
</p>
<p>A list of the principal authorities referred to will be found in another place, but
it would be improper to omit here the acknowledgments which are due to the various
authors of whose work in this field such wide use has been made. Among the dead special
mention must be made of Marsden, who will <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e257">[<a href="#xd32e257">xv</a>]</span>always be for Englishmen the pioneer of Malay studies; Leyden, the gifted translator
of the Sĕjarah Malayu, whose early death probably inflicted on Oriental scholarship
the greatest loss it has ever had to suffer; Newbold, the author of what is still,
on the whole, the best work on the Malay Peninsula; and Sir William Maxwell, in whom
those of us who knew him have lost a friend, and Malay scholarship a thoroughly sound
and most brilliant exponent.
</p>
<p>Among the living, the acknowledgments of the author are due principally to Sir Frank
Swettenham and Mr. Hugh Clifford, who, while they have done much to popularise the
knowledge of things Malay amongst the general reading public, have also embodied in
their works the results of much careful and accurate observation. The free use which
has been made of the writings of these and other authors will, it is hoped, be held
to be justified by their intrinsic value.
</p>
<p>It must be added that the author, having to leave England about the beginning of this
year with the Cambridge scientific expedition which is now exploring the Northern
States of the Peninsula, left the work with me for revision. The first five Chapters
and Chapter VI., up to the end of the section on Dances, Sports, and Games, were then
already in the printer’s hands, but only the first 100 pages or so had had the benefit
of the author’s revision. For the arrangement of the rest of Chapter VI., and for
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e262">[<a href="#xd32e262">xvi</a>]</span>some small portion of the matter therein contained, I am responsible, and it has also
been my duty to revise the whole book finally. Accordingly, it is only fair to the
author to point out that he is to be credited with the matter and the general scheme
of the work, while the responsibility for defects in detail must fall upon myself.
</p>
<p>As regards the spelling of Malay words, it must be said that geographical names have
been spelled in the way which is now usually adopted and without diacritical marks:
the names of the principal Native States of the Peninsula (most of which are repeatedly
mentioned in the book) are Kĕdah, Perak, Sĕlangor, Jŏhor, Păhang, Trĕngganu, Kĕlantan,
and Pătani. Otherwise, except in quotations (where the spelling of the original is
preserved), an attempt has been made to transliterate the Malay words found in the
body of the book in such a way as to give the ordinary reader a fairly correct idea
of their pronunciation. The Appendix, which appeals only to persons who already know
Malay, has been somewhat differently treated, diacritical marks being inserted only
in cases where there was a possible ambiguity, and the spelling of the original MSS.
being changed as little as possible.
</p>
<p>A perfect transliteration, or one that will suit everybody, is, however, an unattainable
ideal, and the most that can be done in that direction is necessarily a compromise.
In the system adopted in the <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e267">[<a href="#xd32e267">xvii</a>]</span>body of the work, the vowels are to be sounded (roughly speaking) as in Italian, except
<i>ĕ</i> (which resembles the French <i>e</i> in <i>que</i>, <i>le</i>, and the like), and the consonants as in English (but <i>ng</i> as in <i>singer</i>, not <i>finger</i>; <i>g</i> as in <i>go</i>; <i>ny</i> as <i>ni</i> in <i>onion</i>; <i>ch</i> as in <i>church</i>; final <i>k</i> and initial <i>h</i> almost inaudible). The symbol ʿ represents the Arabic <i>ʿain</i>, and the symbol ’ is used (1) between consonants, to indicate the presence of an
almost inaudible vowel, the shortest form of <i>ĕ</i>, and elsewhere (2) for the <i>hamzah</i>, and (3) for the apostrophe, <i>i.e.</i> to denote the suppression of a letter or syllable. Both the <i>ʿain</i> and the <i>hamzah</i> may be neglected in pronunciation, as indeed they are very generally disregarded
by the Malays themselves. In this and other respects, Arabic scholars into whose hands
this book may fall must not be surprised to find that Arabic words and phrases suffer
some corruptions in a Malay context. These have not, as a rule, been interfered with
or corrected, although it has not been thought worth while to preserve obvious blunders
of spelling in well-known Arabic formulæ. It should be added that in Malay the accent
or stress, which is less marked than in English, falls almost invariably on the penultimate
syllable of the word. Exceptions to this rule hardly ever occur except in the few
cases where the penultimate is an <i>open</i> syllable with a short vowel, as indicated by the sign ˘.
</p>
<p>The illustrations are reproduced from photographs <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e321">[<a href="#xd32e321">xviii</a>]</span>of models and original objects made by Malays; most of these models and other objects
are now in the Cambridge Archæological and Ethnological Museum, to which they were
presented by the author.
</p>
<p>The Index, for the compilation of which I am indebted to my wife, who has also given
me much assistance in the revision of the proof-sheets, will, it is believed, add
greatly to the usefulness of the work as a book of reference.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The theory of the Creation most usually held by Peninsular Malays is summarised in
the following passage, quoted (in 1839) by Lieutenant Newbold from a Malay folk-tale:—
</p>
<p>“From the Supreme Being first emanated light towards chaos; this light, diffusing
itself, became the vast ocean. From the bosom of the waters thick vapour and foam
ascended. The earth and sea were then formed, each of seven tiers. The earth rested
on the surface of the water from east to west. God, in order to render steadfast the
foundations of the world, which vibrated tremulously with the motion of the watery
expanse, girt it round with an adamantine chain, viz. the stupendous mountains of
Caucasus, the wondrous regions of genii and aerial spirits. Beyond these limits is
spread out a vast plain, the sand and earth of which are of gold and musk, the stones
rubies and emeralds, the vegetation of odoriferous flowers.
</p>
<p>“From the range of Caucasus all the mountains of <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>the earth have their origin as pillars to support and strengthen the terrestrial framework.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1343src" href="#xd32e1343">1</a>
</p>
<p>The Mountains of Caucasus are usually called by Malays Bukit Kof (<i>i.e.</i> Kaf), or the Mountains of Kaf (which latter is their Arabic name). These mountains
are not unfrequently referred to in Malay charms, <i>e.g.</i> in invocations addressed to the Rice-Spirit. The Mountains of Kaf are to the Malays
a great range which serves as a “wall” (<i lang="ms">dinding</i>) to the earth, and keeps off both excessive winds and beasts of prey. This wall,
however, is being bored through by people called Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog),
and when they succeed in their task the end of all things will come. Besides these
mountains which surround the earth there is a great central mountain called Mahameru
(Saguntang Maha Biru, or merely Saguntang-guntang).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1357src" href="#xd32e1357">2</a> In many Malay stories this hill Mahameru is identified with Saguntang-guntang on
the borders of Palembang in Sumatra.
</p>
<p>The account which I shall now give, however, differs considerably from the preceding.
It was taken down by me from an introduction to a Malay charm-book belonging to a
magician (one ʿAbdul Razzak of Klang in Selangor), with whom I was acquainted, but
who, though he allowed me to copy it, would not allow me either to buy or borrow the
book:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1363src" href="#xd32e1363">3</a>—

<p>“In the days when Haze bore Darkness, and Darkness Haze, when the Lord of the Outer
Silence Himself was yet in the womb of Creation, before the existence of the names
of Earth and Heaven, of God and Muhammad, of the Empyrean and Crystalline <span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>spheres, or of Space and Void, the Creator of the entire Universe pre-existed by Himself,
and He was the Eldest Magician. He created the Earth of the width of a tray and the
Heavens of the width of an umbrella, which are the universe of the Magician. Now from
before the beginning of time existed that Magician—that is, God—and He made Himself
manifest with the brightness of the moon and the sun, which is the token of the True
Magician.”
</p>
<p>The account proceeds to describe how God “created the pillar of the Kaʿbah,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1372src" href="#xd32e1372">4</a> which is the Navel of the Earth, whose growth is comparable to a Tree, … whose branches
are four in number, and are called, the first, ‘Sajeratul Mentahar,’ and the second
‘Taubi,’ and the third, ‘Khaldi,’ and the fourth ‘Nasrun ʿAlam,’ which extend unto
the north, south, east, and west, where they are called the Four Corners of the World.”
</p>
<p>Next we read that the word of God Almighty came in secret to Gabriel, saying, “Take
me down the iron staff of the ‘Creed’ which dangles at the gate of heaven, and kill
me this serpent Sakatimuna.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1384src" href="#xd32e1384">5</a> Gabriel did so, and the serpent brake asunder, the head and forepart shooting up
above the heavens, and the tail part penetrating downwards beneath the earth.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1391src" href="#xd32e1391">6</a> The rest of the account is taken up with a description, that need not here be repeated,
of the transformation of all the various parts of the serpent’s anatomy, which <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>are represented as turning with a few exceptions into good and evil genii.
</p>
<p>The most curious feature of the description is perhaps the marked anthropomorphic
character of this serpent, which shows it to be a serpent in little more than name.
It seems, in fact, very probable that we have here a reminiscence of the Indian “Naga.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1402src" href="#xd32e1402">7</a> Thus we find the rainbow (here divided into its component parts) described as originating
from the serpent’s sword with its hilt and cross-piece (guard), grass from the hair
of its body, trees from the hair of its head, rain from its tears, and dew from its
sweat.
</p>
<p>Another account, also obtained from a local magician, contains one or two additional
details about the tree. “<i lang="ms">Kun</i>,” said God, “<i lang="ms">Payah<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1432src" href="#xd32e1432">8</a> kun</i>” said Muhammad, and a seed was created.
</p>
<p>“The seed became a root (lit. sinew), the root a tree, and the tree brought forth
leaves.
</p>
<p>“ ‘<i lang="ms">Kun</i>,’ said God, ‘<i lang="ms">Payah kun</i>,’ said Muhammad; … Then were Heaven and Earth (created), ‘Earth of the width of a
tray, Heaven of the width of an umbrella.’ ”
</p>
<p>This is a curious passage, and one not over-easy to <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>explain; such evidence as may be drawn from analogy suggests, however, that the “Earth
of the width of a tray, and Heaven of the width of an umbrella,” may be intended to
represent respectively the “souls” (<i lang="ms">sĕmangat</i>) of heaven and earth, in which case they would bear the same relation to the material
heaven and earth as the man-shaped human soul does to the body of a man.

<p class="first">“Most Malays,” says Newbold, “with whom I have conversed on the subject, imagine that
the world is of an oval shape, revolving upon its own axis four times in the space
of one year; that the sun is a circular body of fire moving round the earth, and producing
the alternations of night and day.”
</p>
<p>To this I would add that some Malays, at least, whom I questioned on the subject (as
well as some Sakais<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1477src" href="#xd32e1477">9</a> under Malay influence), imagined the firmament to consist of a sort of stone or rock
which they called <i lang="ms">Batu hampar</i>, or “Bed rock,” the appearance of stars being caused (as they supposed) by the light
which streams through its perforations.
</p>
<p>A further development of the Malay theory of the earth declares it to be carried by
a colossal buffalo upon the tip of its horns.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1487src" href="#xd32e1487">10</a> When one horn begins to tire the buffalo tosses it up and catches it upon the tip
of the other, thus causing periodical earthquakes. <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>This world-buffalo, it should be added, stands upon an island in the midst of the
nether ocean.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1495src" href="#xd32e1495">11</a> The universe is girt round by an immense serpent or dragon (Ular Naga), which “feeds
upon its own tail.”
</p>
<p>The Malay theory of the tides is concisely stated by Newbold:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1506src" href="#xd32e1506">12</a>—
</p>
<p>“Some Malays ascribe the tides to the influence of the sun; others to some unknown
current of the ocean; but the generality believe confidently the following, which
is a mere skeleton of the original legend. In the middle of the great ocean grows
an immense tree, called Pauh Jangi,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1513src" href="#xd32e1513">13</a> at the root of <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>which is a cavern called Pusat Tassek, or navel of the lake. This is inhabited by
a vast crab, who goes forth at stated periods during the day. When the creature returns
to its abode the displaced water causes the flow of the tide; when he departs, the
water rushing into the cavern causes the ebb.”
</p>
<p>Mr. Clifford gives a slightly different explanation:—
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">Pusat tasek</i>, or Navel of the Seas, supposed to be a huge hole in the ocean bottom. In this hole
there sits a gigantic crab which twice a day gets out in order to search for food.
While he is sitting in the hole the waters of the ocean are unable to pour down into
the under world, the whole of the aperture being filled and blocked by the crab’s
bulk. The inflowing of the rivers into the sea during these periods are supposed to
cause the rising of the tide, while the downpouring of the waters through the great
hole when the crab is absent searching for food is supposed to cause the ebb.”
</p>
<p>Concerning the wonderful legendary tree (the <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>Pauh Janggi) the following story was related to me by a Selangor Malay:—
</p>
<p>“There was once a Selangor man named Haji Batu, or the Petrified Pilgrim, who got
this name from the fact that the first joints of all the fingers of one hand had been
turned into stone. This happened in the following manner. In the old days when men
went voyaging in sailing vessels, he determined to visit Mecca, and accordingly set
sail. After sailing for about two months they drifted out of their course for some
ten or fifteen days, and then came to a part of the sea where there were floating
trunks of trees, together with rice-straw (<i lang="ms">batang padi</i>) and all manner of flotsam. Yet again they drifted for seven days, and upon the seventh
night Haji Batu dreamed a dream. In this dream one who wore the pilgrim’s garb appeared
to him, and warned him to carry on his person a hammer and seven nails, and when he
came to a tree which would be the Pauh Janggi he was to drive the first of the nails
into its stem and cling thereto. Next day the ship reached the great whirlpool which
is called the Navel of the Seas,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1573src" href="#xd32e1573">14</a> and while <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>the ship was being sucked into the eddy close to the tree and engulfed, Haji Batu
managed to drive the first nail home, and clung to it as the ship went down. After
a brief interval he endeavoured to drive in the second nail, somewhat higher up the
stem than the first (why Haji Batu could not climb without the aid of nails history
does not relate), and drawing himself up by it, drove in the third. Thus progressing,
by the time he had driven in all the seven nails he had reached the top of the tree,
when he discovered among the branches a nest of young rocs. Here he rested, and having
again been advised in a dream, he waited. On the following day, when the parent roc
had returned and was engaged in feeding its young with an elephant which it had brought
for the purpose, he bound himself to its feathers with his girdle, and was carried
in this manner many hundreds of miles to the westward, where, upon the roc’s nearing
the ground, he let himself go, and thus dropping to the earth, fell into a swoon.
On recovering consciousness he walked on till he came to a house, where he asked for
and obtained some refreshment. On his departure he was advised to go westward, and
so proceeded for a long distance until he arrived at a beautifully clear pool in an
open plain, around which were to be seen many stone figures of human beings. The appearance
of these stone figures rendering him suspicious, he <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>refrained from drinking the water, and dipped into it merely the tips of his fingers,
which became immediately petrified. Proceeding he met a vast number of wild animals—pigs,
deer, and elephants—which were fleeing from the pursuit of a beast of no great size
indeed, but with fiery red fur. He therefore prudently climbed into a tree to allow
it to pass. The beast, however, pursued him and commenced to climb the tree, but as
it climbed he drove the point of his poniard (<i lang="ms">badik</i>) into its skull, and killed it. He then robbed it of its whiskers, and thereafter,
on his reaching a town, everybody fled from him because of the whiskers which had
belonged to so fierce a beast. The Raja of that country, begging for one of them,
and giving him food, he presented him with one of the whiskers in payment. After paying
his way in a similar manner at seven successive villages, the Petrified Pilgrim at
length reached Mecca.”
</p>
<p>“Bores,” or “eagres,” at the mouths of rivers, and floods<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1620src" href="#xd32e1620">15</a> due to heavy rain, are conceived to be caused by the passage of some gigantic animal,
most probably a sort of dragon, as in the case of landslips, which will be mentioned
later.
</p>
<p>This animal, whose passage up rivers is held to cause the tidal wave or bore, is called
Bĕnă in Selangor. It is a matter of common report among <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>Malays at Jugra, on the Selangor coast, that a bore formerly “frequented” the Langat
river, near its mouth. This was anterior to the severance of the narrow neck of land<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1637src" href="#xd32e1637">16</a> at Bandar that divided the old channel of the Langat river from the stream into which
the waters of the Langat now flow, forming the short cut to the sea called the Jugra
Passage. In the days when the bore came up the river the Malays used to go out in
small canoes or dug-outs to “sport amongst the breakers” (<i lang="ms">main gĕlombang</i>), frequently getting upset for their pains. Eventually, however (I was told), the
bore was killed by a Langat Malay, who struck it upon the head with a stick! It is
considered that this must be true, since there is no bore in the Langat river now!
</p>
<p>Eclipses (<i lang="ms">Gĕrhana</i>) of the sun or moon are considered to be the outward and visible sign of the devouring
of those bodies<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1648src" href="#xd32e1648">17</a> by a sort of gigantic dragon (<i lang="ms">rahu</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1656src" href="#xd32e1656">18</a> or dog (<i lang="ms">anjing</i>). Hence the tumult <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>made during an eclipse by the Malays, who imagine that if they make a sufficient din
they will frighten the monster away.
</p>
<p>The following is an excellent description of a lunar eclipse from the Malay point
of view:—
</p>
<p>“One night, when the Moon has waxed nearly to the full, Pĕkan resounds with a babel
of discordant noise. The large brass gongs, in which the devils of the Chinese are
supposed to take delight, clang and clash and bray through the still night air; the
Malay drums throb and beat and thud; all manner of shrill yells fill the sky, and
the roar of a thousand native voices rises heavenwards, or rolls across the white
waters of the river, which are flecked with deep shadows and reflections. The jungles
on the far bank take up the sound and send it pealing back in recurring ringing echoes
till the whole world seems to shout in chorus. The Moon which bathes the earth in
splendour, the Moon which is so dear to each one of us, is in dire peril this night,
for that fierce monster, the <i lang="ms">Gĕrhâna</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1686src" href="#xd32e1686">19</a> whom we hate and loathe, is striving to swallow her. You can mark his black bulk
creeping over her, dimming her face, consuming her utterly, while she suffers in the
agony of silence. How often in the past has she served us with the light; how often
has she made night more beautiful than day for our tired, sun-dazed eyes to look upon;
and shall she now perish without one effort on our part to save her by scaring the
Monster from his prey? No! A thousand times no! So we shout, and clang the gongs,
and beat the drums, till all the animal world joins in the tumult, and even inanimate
nature lends its voice to swell the <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>uproar with a thousand resonant echoes. At last the hated Monster reluctantly retreats.
Our war-cry has reached his ears, and he slinks sullenly away, and the pure, sad,
kindly Moon looks down in love and gratitude upon us, her children, to whose aid she
owes her deliverance.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1696src" href="#xd32e1696">20</a>
</p>
<p>The “spots on the moon”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1707src" href="#xd32e1707">21</a> are supposed to represent an inverted banyan tree (<i lang="ms">Bĕringin songsang</i>), underneath which an aged hunchback is seated plaiting strands of tree bark (<i lang="ms">pintal tali kulit t’rap</i>) to make a fishing-line, wherewith he intends to angle for everything upon the earth
as soon as his task is completed. It has never been completed yet, however, for a
rat always gnaws the line through in time to save mankind from disaster, despite the
vigilance of the old man’s cat, which is always lying in wait for the offender.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1729src" href="#xd32e1729">22</a> It is perhaps scarcely necessary to add that when the line reaches the earth the
end of the world will come.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Bujang</i> (‘single,’ ‘solitary,’ and hence in a secondary sense ‘unmarried’) is a Sanskrit
word <i lang="ms">bhujangga</i>, ‘a dragon.’ ‘Bujang Malaka,’ a mountain in Pêrak, is said by the Malays of that
State to have been so called because it stands <i>alone</i>, and could be seen from the sea by traders who plied in old days between the Pêrak
river and the once flourishing port <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>of Malacca. But it is just as likely to have been named from some forgotten legend
in which a dragon played a part. Dragons and mountains are generally connected in
Malay ideas. The caves in the limestone hill Gunong Pondok, in Pêrak, are said to
be haunted by a <i lang="la">genius loci</i> in the form of a snake who is popularly called <i lang="ms">Si Bujang</i>. This seems to prove beyond doubt the identity of <i lang="ms">bujang</i> with <i lang="ms">bhujangga</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1759src" href="#xd32e1759">23</a> The snake-spirit of Gunong Pondok is sometimes as small as a viper, and sometimes
as large as a python, but he may always be identified by his spotted neck, which resembles
that of a wood-pigeon (<i lang="ms">tekukur</i>). Landslips on the mountains, which are tolerably frequent during very heavy rains,
and which, being produced by the same cause, are often simultaneous with the flooding
of rivers and the destruction of property, are attributed by the natives to the sudden
breaking forth of dragons (<i lang="ms">naga</i>), which have been performing religious penance (<i lang="ms">ber-tapa</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1772src" href="#xd32e1772">24</a> in the mountains, and which are making their way to the sea.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1778src" href="#xd32e1778">25</a>
</p>
<p>So, too, many waterfalls and rocks of unusual shape are thought to owe their remarkable
character to the agency of demons. This, however, is a subject which will be treated
more fully later on.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Palangi</i>, the usual Malay word for the rainbow, means ‘striped.’ The name varies, however,
in different localities. In Pêrak it is called <i lang="ms">palangi minum</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1793src" href="#xd32e1793">26</a> (from a belief that it is the path by which spirits descend to the earth to drink),
while in Penang it is known as <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span><i lang="ms">ular danu</i> (‘the snake <i lang="ms">danu</i>’). In Pêrak, a rainbow which stretches in an arch across the sky is called <i lang="ms">bantal</i> (‘the pillow’), for some reason that I have been unable to ascertain.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1810src" href="#xd32e1810">27</a> When only a small portion of a rainbow is visible, which seems to touch the earth,
it is called <i lang="ms">tunggul</i> (‘the flag’),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1819src" href="#xd32e1819">28</a> and if this is seen at some particular point of the compass—the west, I think—it
betokens, the Pêrak Malays say, the approaching death of a Raja. Another popular belief
is that the ends of the rainbow rest upon the earth, and that if one could dig at
the exact spot covered by one end of it, an untold treasure would be found there.
Unfortunately, no one can ever arrive at the place.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1834src" href="#xd32e1834">29</a>
</p>
<p>“Sunset is the hour when evil spirits of all kinds have most power.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1843src" href="#xd32e1843">30</a> In Pêrak, children are often called indoors at this time to save them from unseen
dangers. Sometimes, with the same object, a woman belonging to the house where there
are young children, will chew <i lang="ms">kuniet tĕrus</i> (an evil-smelling root), supposed to be much disliked by demons of all kinds, and
spit it out at seven different points as she walks round the house.
</p>
<p>“The yellow glow which spreads over the western sky, when it is lighted up with the
last rays of the dying sun, is called <i lang="ms">mambang kuning</i> (‘the yellow deity’), a term indicative of the superstitious dread associated with
this particular period.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1854src" href="#xd32e1854">31</a>

Ocean, most frequently on the Maldive Islands, but occasionally also on Ceylon and
S. India, and on the coasts of Zanzibar, of Sumatra, and some others of the Malay
Islands. Great virtues as medicine and antidote were supposed to reside in these fruits,
and extravagant prices were paid for them. The story goes that a ‘country captain,’
expecting to make his fortune, took a cargo of these nuts from the Seychelles Islands
to Calcutta, but the only result was to destroy their value for the future.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“The old belief was that the fruit was produced on a palm growing below the sea, whose
fronds, according to Malay seamen, were sometimes seen in quiet bights on the Sumatran
coast, especially in the Lampong Bay. According to one form of the story among the
Malays, which is told both by Pigafetta and by Rumphius, there was but one such tree,
the fronds of which rose above an abyss of the Southern Ocean, and were the abode
of the monstrous bird Garuda (or Rukh of the Arabs). The tree itself was called <i lang="ms">Pau-sengi</i>, which Rumphius seems to interpret as a corruption of <i lang="ms">Buwa-zangi</i>, ‘Fruit of Zang,’ or E. Africa. They were cast up occasionally on the islands of
the S.W. coast of Sumatra; and the wild people of the islands brought them for sale
to the Sumatran marts, such as Padang and Priamang. One of the largest (say about
twelve inches across) would sell for 150 rix dollars. But the Malay princes coveted
them greatly, and would sometimes (it was alleged) give a laden junk for a single
nut. In India the best-known source of supply was from the Maldive Islands.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“The medical virtues of the nut were not only famous among all the people of the East,
including the Chinese, but are extolled by Piso and by Rumphius, with many details.
The latter, learned and laborious student of nature as he was, believed in the submarine origin of the nut, though he discredited its growing
on a great palm, as no traces of such a plant had ever been discovered on the coasts.
The fame of the nut’s virtues had extended to Europe, and the Emperor Rudolf II. in
his latter days offered in vain 4000 florins to purchase from the family of Wolfert
Hermanszen, a Dutch Admiral, one which had been presented to that commander by the
King of Bantam, on the Hollander’s relieving his capital, attacked by the Portuguese
in 1602.”—<i>Hobson-Jobson</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">To this valuable note I would add that Rumphius is evidently wrong if he derives the
name of the tree, “Pau-sengi,” from the Malay “Buwa-zangi.” The first part of the
word is “Pau” or “Pauh,” which is perfectly good Malay, and is the name given to various
species of mango, especially the wild one, so that “Pau-sengi” actually represents
(not “Buwa,” but) “Pauh Janggi,” which is to this day the universal Malay name for
the tree which grows, according to Malay fable, in the central whirlpool or Navel
of the Seas. Some versions add that it grows upon a sunken bank (<i lang="ms">tĕbing runtoh</i>), and is guarded by dragons. This tree figures largely in Malay romances, especially
those which form the subject of Malay shadow-plays, (<i>vide infra</i>, Pl. 23, for an illustration of the Pauh Janggi and the Crab). Rumphius’ explanation
of the second part of the name (<i>i.e.</i> Janggi) is, no doubt, quite correct.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e1513src" title="Return to note 13 in text.">↑</a></p>

</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“Presently he arrived at his destination—the Navel of the Seas—(<i lang="ms">Pusat tasek</i>). All the monsters of the ocean, the whales and monster fishes, and colossal dragons
(<i lang="ms">naga umbang</i>), and the magic dragons (<i lang="ms">naga sri naga ka-sak-tian</i>), assembled together to eat and devour him, and such a tumult arose that the Raja
Naga, who was superior to all, heard it and came to see. Now when he beheld the Golden
Dragon he opened his jaws to their full extent, and made three attempts to seize and
swallow him, but failed each time. At length, however, he caught him, and dashed him
against the sea bottom with such force that his head was buried in the ground, but
the little dragon cared not at all. Then the Raja Naga said: ‘Tell me the truth! from
what land hast thou fallen (<i lang="ms">titek dĕri pada nĕgri ninggua mana</i>), and whose son and offspring art thou?’ To which the Golden Dragon made answer,
saying, ‘I have no land nor country, I have neither father nor mother, but I was incarnated
from the hollow part of a bamboo!’ When the Raja Naga heard this he sent for his spectacles
(<i lang="ms">chĕrmin mata</i>), and by their aid he was able to see the real parentage of the Golden Dragon and
all concerning him, and he at once told him everything concerning his birth (<i lang="ms">usul asal ka-jadi-an-nya</i>), and informed him that they were close relations, since the Golden Dragon’s mother
was a relative of the Raja Naga. Then the Raja Naga kissed and embraced his nephew,
and congratulated himself on having seen him before his time came to die, and calling
together all his people to feast, installed (<i lang="ms">tabal</i>) the Golden Dragon as king over them in his own place, since he was very old. Thus
the Golden Dragon continued to live in increasing state and prosperity at the <i lang="ms">Pusat tasek</i>, and was greatly beloved by his uncle, the Raja Naga; and in the course of time his
horn (<i lang="ms">chula</i>) split up and was replaced by six other heads—making seven in all.”—<i lang="ms">Hikayat Raja Budiman</i>, part ii. pp. 7, 8.

<p class="first">A common feature in Malay romances and legends is a description of the supernatural
development of a young child in the interior of some vegetable production, usually
a bamboo.
</p>
<p>Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell has pointed out the fact of the existence, both in Malay and Japanese
legends, of the main features of this story, to which he assigns a Buddhistic origin.
He tells the story as follows:—
</p>
<p>“<i>The Raja of the Bamboo.</i>—Some years ago I collected a number of legends current among Malayan tribes having
as their principal incident the supernatural development of a prince, princess, or
demi-god in the stem of a bamboo, or tree, or the interior of some closed receptacle.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1882src" href="#xd32e1882">1</a> I omitted, however, to mention that this very characteristic Malay myth occurs in
the “Sri Rama,” a Malay prose <i lang="ms">hikayat</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1895src" href="#xd32e1895">2</a> which, as its <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>name betokens, professes to describe the adventures of the hero of the Râmâyana.
</p>
<p>“Roorda van Eysinga’s edition of the Sri Rama opens with an account of how Maharaja
Dasaratha sent his Chief Mantri,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1906src" href="#xd32e1906">3</a> Puspa Jaya Karma, to search for a suitable place at which to found a settlement.
The site having been found and cleared, the narrative proceeds as follows:—
</p>
<p>“ ‘Now there was a clump of the <i lang="ms">bĕtong</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1917src" href="#xd32e1917">4</a> bamboo (<i lang="ms">sa’rumpun buluh bĕtong</i>), the colour of which was like gold of ten touch (<i lang="ms">amas sapuloh mutu</i>), and its leaves like silver. All the trees which grew near bent in its direction,
and it looked like a state umbrella (<i lang="ms">payong manuwangi</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1932src" href="#xd32e1932">5</a>). The Mantri and people chopped at it, but as fast as they cut down a branch on one
side, a fresh one shot forth on the other, to the great astonishment of all the Rajas,
Mantris, and warriors. Puspa Vikrama Jaya hastened back to King Dasaratha and laid
the matter before him. The latter was greatly surprised, and declared that he would
go himself the next day and see the bamboo cut down. Next day he set out on a white
elephant, attended by a splendid train of chiefs and followers, and on reaching the
spot ordered the bamboo clump to be cut down. Vikrama Puspa Jaya pointed it out, shaded
by the other forest trees. The king perceived that it was of very elegant appearance,
and that an odour like spices and musk proceeded from it. He told Puspa Jaya Vikrama
to cut it down, and the latter drew his sword, which was as big as the stem of a cocoa-nut
tree, and with one stroke cut down one of the bamboos. But immediately a fresh stem
shot forth on the other side, and this happened <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>as often as a stroke was given. Then the king grew wroth, and getting down from his
elephant he drew his own sword and made a cut with it at the bamboo, which severed
a stem. Then, by the divine decree of the Dewatas, the king became aware of a female
form in the bamboo clump seated on a highly ornamented platform (<i lang="ms">gĕta</i>), her face shining like the full moon when it is fourteen days old, and the colour
of her body being like gold of ten touch. On this, King Dasaratha quickly unloosed
his girdle and saluted the princess. Then he lifted her on to his elephant and took
her to his palace escorted by music and singing.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1951src" href="#xd32e1951">6</a>
</p>
<p>I myself have heard among the Selangor Malays similar legends to the above, which,
as already pointed out, are common in Malay romances. A parallel myth is described
in the following words:—
</p>
<p>“Now, the Perak river overflows its banks once a year, and sometimes there are very
great floods. Soon after the marriage of Nakhodah Kasim with the white Semang,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1962src" href="#xd32e1962">7</a> an unprecedented flood occurred and quantities of foam came down the river. Round
the piles of the bathing-house, which, in accordance with Malay custom, stood in the
bed of the river close to the bank in front of the house, the floating volumes of
foam collected in a mass the size of an elephant. Nakhodah Kasim’s wife went to bathe,
and finding this island of froth in her way she attempted to move it away with a stick;
she removed the upper portion of it and disclosed a female infant <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>sitting in the midst of it enveloped all round with cloud-like foam. The child showed
no fear, and the white Semang, carefully lifting her, carried her up to the house,
heralding her discovery by loud shouts to her husband. The couple adopted the child
willingly, for they had no children, and they treated her thenceforward as their own.
They assembled the villagers and gave them a feast, solemnly announcing their adoption
of the daughter of the river and their intention of leaving to her everything that
they possessed.
</p>
<p>“The child was called Tan Puteh, but her father gave her the name of Teh Purba.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1971src" href="#xd32e1971">8</a> As she grew up the wealth of her foster-parents increased; the village grew in extent
and population, and gradually became an important place.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1988src" href="#xd32e1988">9</a>
</p>
<p>The usual story of the first creation of man, however, appears to be a Malay modification
of Arabic beliefs.
</p>
<p>Thus we are told that man was created from the four elements—earth, air, water, and
fire—in a way which the following extract, taken from a Selangor charm-book, will
explain:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“God Almighty spake unto Gabriel, saying,
</p>
<p class="line">‘Be not disobedient, O Gabriel,
</p>
<p class="line">But go and get me the Heart of the Earth.’
</p>
<p class="line">But he could not get the Heart of the Earth.
</p>
<p class="line">‘I will not give it,’ said the Earth.
</p>
<p class="line">Then went the Prophet Israfel to get it,
</p>
<p class="line">But he could not get the Heart of the Earth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Then went Michael to get it,
</p>
<p class="line">But he could not get the Heart of the Earth.
</p>
<p class="line">Then went Azrael to get it,
</p>
<p class="line">And at last he got the Heart of the Earth.
</p>
<p class="line">When he got the Heart of the Earth
</p>
<p class="line">The empyrean and crystalline spheres shook,
</p>
<p class="line">And the whole Universe (shook).
</p>
<p class="line">When he got the Heart of the Earth he<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2021src" href="#xd32e2021">10</a> made from it the Image of Adam.
</p>
<p class="line">But the Heart of the Earth was then too hard;
</p>
<p class="line">He mixed Water with it, and it became too soft,
</p>
<p class="line">(So) he mixed Fire with it, and at last struck out the image of Adam.
</p>
<p class="line">Then he raised up the image of Adam,
</p>
<p class="line">And craved Life for it from Almighty God,
</p>
<p class="line">And God Almighty gave it Life.
</p>
<p class="line">Then sneezed God Almighty, and the image of Adam brake in pieces,
</p>
<p class="line">And he (Azrael) returned to remake the image of Adam.
</p>
<p class="line">Then God Almighty commanded to take steel of Khorassan,
</p>
<p class="line">And drive it down his back, so that it became the thirty-three bones,
</p>
<p class="line">The harder steel at the top, the softer below it.
</p>
<p class="line">The harder steel shot up skywards,
</p>
<p class="line">And the softer steel penetrated earthwards.
</p>
<p class="line">Thus the image of Adam had life, and dwelt in Paradise.
</p>
<p class="line">(There) Adam beheld (two&nbsp;?) peacocks of no ordinary beauty,
</p>
<p class="line">And the Angel Gabriel appeared.
</p>
<p class="line">‘Verily, O Angel Gabriel, I am solitary,
</p>
<p class="line">Easier is it to live in pairs, I crave a wife.’
</p>
<p class="line">God Almighty spake, saying, ‘Command Adam
</p>
<p class="line">To pray at dawn a prayer of two genuflexions.’
</p>
<p class="line">Then Adam prayed, and our Lady Eve descended,
</p>
<p class="line">And was captured by the Prophet Adam;
</p>
<p class="line">But before he had finished his prayer she was taken back,
</p>
<p class="line">Therefore Adam prayed the prayer of two genuflexions as desired,
</p>
<p class="line">And at the last obtained our Lady Eve.
</p>
<p class="line">When they were married (Eve) bore twins every time,
</p>
<p class="line">Until she had borne forty-four children,
</p>
<p class="line">And the children, too, were wedded, handsome with handsome, and plain with plain.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The magician who dictated the above account stated that when Azrael stretched forth
his hand to take the Heart of the Earth, the Earth-spirit caught hold of his middle
finger, which yielded to the strain, and thus became longer than the rest, and received
its Malay name of the “Devil’s Finger” (<i lang="ms">jari hantu</i>).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>A parallel account adds that the Heart of the Earth was white, and gives a fuller
description of the interview between Azrael and his formidable antagonist, the Earth.
After saluting the latter in the orthodox Muhammadan fashion, Azrael explains his
mission, and is met by a point-blank refusal. “I will not give it,” said the Earth
(referring to its Heart), “forasmuch as I was so created by God Almighty, and if you
take away my Heart I shall assuredly die.” At this brusque, though perhaps natural
retort, the archangel loses his temper, and rudely exclaims that he “will take the
Earth’s Heart whether it will or no.” Here Azrael “gave the Earth a push with his
right hand and his left, and grasping at the Heart of the Earth, got hold of it and
carried it back to the presence of God.” God now summons Gabriel and orders him to
mould (lit. forge) the image of Adam. Then Gabriel took the lump of earth which was
the Earth’s Heart and mixed it first with water to soften it, then, as it was too
soft, with fire to harden it, and when the image was made, obtained life from God
to put into it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2062src" href="#xd32e2062">11</a> [The breaking of the first image which <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>was made, and the making of the second, are here omitted]. Finally, the creation of
“our Lady” Eve and the birth of her first-born are described, the latter occasion
being accompanied by a thick darkness, which compelled Adam to take off his turban
and beat the child therewith in order to dispel the evil influences (<i lang="ms">badi</i>) which had attended its birth.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2077src" href="#xd32e2077">12</a>
</p>
<p>The following extract (from a Malay treatise quoted by Newbold) fairly describes the
general state of Malay ideas respecting the constitution of the human body:—
</p>
<p>“Plato, Socrates, Galen, Aristotle, and other philosophers affirm that God created
man of a fixed number of bones, blood-vessels, etc. For instance, the skull is composed
of 5½ bones, the place of smell and sense of 7 bones, between this and the neck are
32 bones. The neck is composed of 7 bones, and the back of 24 bones; 208 bones are
contained in the other members of the body. In all there are 360 bones and 360 blood-vessels
in a man’s body. The brains weigh 306 <i>miscals</i>, the blood 573. The total of all the bones, blood-vessels, large and small, and gristles,
amounts to 1093; and the hairs of the head to six <i>lacs</i> and 4000. The frame of man is divided into 40 great parts, which are again <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>subdivided. Four elements enter into his composition, viz. air, fire, earth, and water.
With these elements are connected four essences—the soul or spirit with air, love
with fire, concupiscence with earth, and wisdom with water.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2093src" href="#xd32e2093">13</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">(<i>b</i>)</span> <i>Sanctity of the Body</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In dealing with this branch of the subject I will first take the case of the kings
and priestly magicians who present the most clearly-marked examples of personal sanctity
which are now to be found among Malays, and will then describe the chief features
of the sanctity ascribed to all ranks alike in respect of certain special parts of
the ordinary human anatomy. The theory of the king as the Divine Man is held perhaps
as strongly in the Malay region as in any other part of the world, a fact which is
strikingly emphasised by the alleged right of Malay monarchs “<i>to slay at pleasure, without being guilty of a crime</i>.” Not only is the king’s person considered sacred, but the sanctity of his body is
believed to communicate itself to his regalia, and to slay those who break the royal
taboos. Thus it is firmly believed that any one who seriously offends the royal person,
who touches (even for a moment) or who imitates (even with the king’s permission)
the chief objects of the regalia,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2115src" href="#xd32e2115">14</a> or who wrongfully makes use <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>of any of the insignia or privileges of royalty, will be <i lang="ms">kĕna daulat</i>, <i>i.e.</i> struck dead, by a quasi-electric discharge of that Divine Power which the Malays
suppose to reside in the king’s person,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2130src" href="#xd32e2130">15</a> and which is called “Daulat” or “Royal Sanctity.” Before I proceed, however, to discuss
this power, it will be best to give some description of the regalia in which it resides:—
</p>
<p>Of Malacca Newbold says: “The articles of Malay regalia usually consist of a <i lang="ms">silasila</i>, or book of genealogical descent, a code of laws, a vest or <i lang="ms">baju</i>, and a few weapons, generally a <i lang="ms">kris</i>, <i lang="ms">kleywang</i>, or spear.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2152src" href="#xd32e2152">16</a>
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">limbing</i> is a sort of lance; the <i lang="ms">tombak bandrang</i> a spear of state, four or seven of which are usually carried before the chiefs in
the interior of the Peninsula. The handle is covered with a substance flowing from
it like a horse-tail, dyed crimson, sometimes crimson and white; this is generally
of hair.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2163src" href="#xd32e2163">17</a>
</p>
<p>So in Leyden’s translation of the <i>Malay Annals</i> (1821) we read—
</p>
<p>“My name is Bichitram Shah, who am raja.… This is the sword, Chora sa mendang kian
(i.e. <i lang="ms">mandakini</i>), and that is the lance, Limbuar (i.e. <i lang="ms">limbuara</i>); this is the signet, Cayu Gampit, which is employed in correspondence with rajas.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2179src" href="#xd32e2179">18</a>
</p>
<p>“The Chora sa medang kian (i.e. <i lang="ms">mandakini</i>) is the <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>celebrated sword with which Peramas Cumunbang killed the enormous serpent Sicatimuna,
which ravaged the country of Menangkabowe about the beginning of the twelfth century.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2191src" href="#xd32e2191">19</a>
</p>
<p>Of the Perak regalia we read: “Tan Saban was commanded by his mistress to open negotiations
with Johor, and this having been done, a prince of the royal house of that kingdom,
who traced his descent from the old line of Menangkabau, sailed for Perak to assume
the sovereignty. He brought with him the insignia of royalty, namely, the royal drums
(<i lang="ms">gandang nobat</i>), the pipes (<i lang="ms">nafiri</i>), the flutes (<i lang="ms">sarunei</i> and <i lang="ms">bangsi</i>), the betel-box (<i lang="ms">puan naga taru</i>), the sword (<i lang="ms">chora mandakini</i>), the sword (<i lang="ms">perbujang</i>), the sceptre (<i lang="ms">kayu gamit</i>), the jewel (<i lang="ms">kamala</i>), the <i lang="ms">surat chiri</i>, the seal of state (<i lang="ms">chap halilintar</i>), and the umbrella (<i lang="ms">ubar-ubar</i>). All these were enclosed in a box called <i lang="ms">Baninan</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2271src" href="#xd32e2271">20</a>
</p>
<p>In Selangor the regalia consisted of the royal instruments of music—(the big State
Drum or <i lang="ms">naubat</i>, beaten at the king’s coronation; the two small State Drums (<i lang="ms">gĕndang</i>); the two State Kettle-drums (<i lang="ms">langkara</i>); the <i lang="ms">lĕmpiri</i> or State Trumpet, and the <i lang="ms">sĕrunei</i> or State Flute—to which perhaps a <i lang="ms">bangsi</i> should be added, as in the Perak list)—which were seldom, if ever, moved, and the
following articles which were carried in procession on state occasions:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2298src" href="#xd32e2298">21</a>—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>

mentioned hitherto being carried in front of the Sultan).

<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">7.</span> The eight royal tufted Lances (<i lang="ms">tombak bĕndrang</i> or <i lang="ms">bandangan</i>), whose bearers were followed by two personal attendants, the latter of whom attended,

persons in all.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2351src" href="#xd32e2351">22</a></li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Of the Pahang regalia I have not been able to obtain a list with any pretensions to
completeness, but from a remark by Mr. Clifford (the present Resident) in one of his
books, they would appear to be essentially the same as those of the other Federated
States.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2371src" href="#xd32e2371">23</a>
</p>
<p>A list of the Jĕlĕbu regalia (given me by Ungku Said Kĕchil of Jĕlĕbu) ran as follows:—
</p>
<ul>
<li>1. A single-bladed Sword (<i lang="ms">pĕdang pĕmanchor</i>).
</li>
<li>2. The Long K’ris (<i lang="ms">k’ris panjang</i>, <i lang="ms">pĕnyalang</i>), used for executions.

<li>3. The royal Lances (<i lang="ms">tombak bĕndrang</i>).
</li>
<li>4. The royal Umbrella (<i lang="ms">payong kabĕsaran</i>).
</li>
<li>5. The royal Standard and Pennants (<i lang="ms">tunggul ular-ular</i>).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span></li>
<li>6. The royal Ceiling-cloth and Hangings (<i lang="ms">tabir</i>, <i lang="ms">langit-langit dewangga</i>).
</li>
<li>7. The “Moving Mountains” (<i lang="ms">gunong dua bĕrangkat</i>), perhaps the names of two peaked pillows.
</li>
<li>8. The royal Drums (<i lang="ms">gĕndang naubat</i>); said to be “headed” with the skins of lice (<i lang="ms">kulit tuma</i>) and to emit a single chord of twelve tones when struck (<i lang="ms">dua-b’las bunyi sakali di-pukol</i>).
</li>
<li>

</div>
</li>
<li>12. The royal <i lang="ms">rĕbab</i> or Malay fiddle.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>This latter peculiarity (of the multiplication of notes) is quite in accordance with
the traditions of the king’s musical instruments in Malay romances. Thus of Raja Donan’s
magic flute we are told, “The first time (that he sounded it), the flute gave forth
the sounds of twelve instruments, the second time it played as if twenty-four instruments
were being sounded, and the third time it played like thirty-six different instruments.”
No wonder we are told that “the Princesses Che Ambong and Che Muda dissolved in tears,
and the music had to be stopped.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2466src" href="#xd32e2466">24</a>
</p>
<p>My informant declared that these objects came into existence of themselves (<i lang="ms">tĕrjali sĕndiri</i>), at a spot between the two peaks of a burning mountain (<i lang="ms">gunong mĕrapi</i>) in the country of Menangkabau in Sumatra. He also averred that “rain could not rot
them nor sun blister them,” and that any one who “brushed past them” (<i lang="ms">di-lintas</i>) would fall to the ground;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2486src" href="#xd32e2486">25</a> whilst no fewer than seven buffaloes have to be slaughtered <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>before the “moving mountains” (when worn out) can be replaced.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2499src" href="#xd32e2499">26</a>
</p>
<p>An enumeration of the writer’s regalia often forms an important part of a letter from
one Malay sovereign to another, more especially when the writer wishes to emphasise
his importance.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2514src" href="#xd32e2514">27</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the extraordinary strength of the Malay belief in the supernatural powers of the
regalia of their sovereigns can only be thoroughly realised after a study of their
romances, in which their kings are credited with all the attributes of inferior gods,
whose birth, as indeed every subsequent act of their after life, is attended by the
most amazing prodigies.
</p>
<p>They are usually invulnerable, and are gifted with miraculous powers, such as that
of transforming themselves, and of returning to (or recalling others to) life; in
fact they have, in every way, less of the man about them and more of the god. Thus
it is that the following description of the dress of an old-time Raja falls easily
into line with what would otherwise appear the objectless jargon which still constitutes
the preamble of many a Malay prince’s letters, but which can yet be hardly regarded
as mere rhetoric, since it has a deep meaning for those who read it:—
</p>
<p>“He wore the trousers called <i lang="ms">bĕraduwanggi</i>, miraculously made without letting in pieces; hundreds of mirrors encircled his waist,
thousands encircled his <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>legs, they were sprinkled all about his body, and larger ones followed the seams.”
</p>
<p>Then his waistband (<i lang="ms">kain ikat pinggang</i>) was of “flowered cloth, twenty-five cubits in length, or thirty if the fringe be
included; thrice a day did it change its colours—in the morning transparent as dew,
at mid-day of the colour of <i lang="ms">lembayong</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2626src" href="#xd32e2626">28</a> and in the evening of the hue of oil.”
</p>
<p>Next came his coat. It was “of reddish purple velvet, thrice brilliant the lustre
of its surface, seven times powerful the strength of the dye; the dyer after making
it sailed the world for three years, but the dye still clung to the palms of his hands.”
</p>
<p>His dagger was “a straight blade of one piece which spontaneously screwed itself into
the haft. The grooves, called <i lang="ms">rĕtak mayat</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2655src" href="#xd32e2655">29</a> started from the base of the blade, the damask called <i lang="ms">pamur janji</i> appeared half-way up, and the damask called <i lang="ms">lam jilallah</i> at the point; the damask <i lang="ms">alif</i> was there parallel with the edge, and where the damasking ended the steel was white.
No ordinary metal was the steel, it was what was over after making the bolt of God’s
Ka’abah (at Meccah). It had been forged by the son of God’s prophet, Adam, smelted
in the palm of his hand, fashioned with the end of his finger, and coloured with the
juice <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>of flowers in a Chinese furnace. Its deadly qualities came down to it from the sky,
and if cleaned (with acid) at the source of a river, the fish at the <i>embouchure</i> came floating up dead.
</p>
<p>“The sword that he wore was called <i lang="ms">lang pĕngonggong</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2677src" href="#xd32e2677">30</a> ‘the successful swooper,’ lit. the ‘kite carrying off its prey.’
</p>
<p>“The next article described is his turban, which, among the Malays, is a square handkerchief
folded and knotted round the head.”
</p>
<p>“He next took his royal handkerchief, knotting it so that it stood up with the ends
projecting; one of them he called <i lang="ms">dĕndam ta’ sudah</i> (endless love): it was purposely unfinished; if it were finished the end of the world
would come. It had been woven in no ordinary way, but had been the work of his mother
from her youth. Wearing it he was provided with all the love-compelling secrets. (The
names of a number of charms to excite passion are given, but they cannot be explained
in the compass of a note).”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2693src" href="#xd32e2693">31</a>
</p>
<p>He wore the Malay national garment—the <i lang="ms">sarong</i>. It was “a robe of muslin of the finest kind; no ordinary weaving had produced it;
it had been woven in a jar in the middle of the ocean by people with gills, relieved
by others with beaks; no sooner was it finished than the maker was put to death, so
that no one might be able to make one like it. It was not of the fashion of the clothing
of the rajas of the present day, but of those of olden time. If it were put in the
sun it got damper, if it were soaked in water it became drier. A slight tear mended
by darning only increased <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>its value, instead of lessening it, for the thread for the purpose cost one hundred
dollars. A single dewdrop dropping on it would tangle the thread for a cubit’s length,
while the breath of the south wind would disentangle it.”
</p>
<p>Finally, we get a description of the way in which the Raja (S’ri Rama) set out upon
his journey.
</p>
<p>“He adopted the art called <i lang="ms">sedang budiman</i>, the young snake writhed at his feet (<i>i.e.</i> he started at mid-day when his own shadow was round his feet), a young eagle was
flying against the wind overhead; he took a step forward and then two backward, one
forward as a sign that he was leaving his country, and two backward as a sign that
he would return; as he took a step with the right foot, loud clanked his accoutrements<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2740src" href="#xd32e2740">32</a> on his left; as he put forth the left foot a similar clank was heard on his right;
he advanced, swelling out his broad chest, and letting drop his slender fingers, adopting
the gait called ‘planting beans,’ and then the step called ‘sowing spinach.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2746src" href="#xd32e2746">33</a>
</p>
<p>In addition to the sanctity of the regalia, the king, as the divine man, possesses
an infinite multitude of prerogatives which enter into almost every act of his private
life, and thus completely separate him from the generality of his fellow-men.
</p>
<p>These prerogatives are too numerous to be mentioned in detail, but the following extract
from Leyden’s translation of the “Malay Annals” will give a general idea of their
character and extent:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Sultan Muhammed Shah again established in order the throne of his sovereignty. He
was the first who prohibited the wearing of yellow clothes in public, not even a handkerchief
of that colour, nor curtains, nor hangings, nor large pillow-cases, nor coverlets,
nor any envelope of any bundle, nor the cloth lining of a house, excepting only the
waist cloth, the coat, and the turban. He also prohibited the constructing of houses
with abutments, or smaller houses connected with them; also suspended pillars or timbers
(<i lang="ms">tiang gantong</i>); nor timbers the tops of which project above the roofs, and also summer houses.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2763src" href="#xd32e2763">34</a> He also prohibited the ornamenting of creeses with gold, and the wearing anklets
of gold, and the wearing the <i lang="ms">koronchong</i>, or hollow bracelets (anklets?) of gold, ornamented with silver. None of these prohibited
articles did he permit to be worn by a person, however rich he might be, unless by
his particular licence, a privilege which the raja has ever since possessed. He also
forbade any one to enter the palace unless wearing a cloth petticoat<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2774src" href="#xd32e2774">35</a> of decent length, with his <i>creese</i> in front;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2790src" href="#xd32e2790">36</a> and a shoulder-cloth; and no person was permitted to enter unless in this array,
and if any one wore his <i>creese</i> behind him, it was incumbent on the porter of the gate to seize it. Such is the order
of former time respecting prohibition by the Malayu rajas, and whatever is contrary
to this is a transgression against the raja, and ought to incur a fine of five <i>cati</i>. The white <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>umbrella, which is superior to the yellow one, because it is seen conspicuous at a
greater distance, was also confined to the raja’s person,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2802src" href="#xd32e2802">37</a> while the yellow umbrella was confined to his family.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2807src" href="#xd32e2807">38</a>
</p>
<p>A number of other particulars bearing on this subject will be found in other parts
of the text, and in the Appendix references are given to other works for additional
details, which are too numerous to be recorded here.
</p>
<p>“At funerals, whether the deceased has been a great or insignificant person, if he
be a subject, the use of the Payong (umbrella) and the <i lang="ms">Puwadi</i> is interdicted, as also the distribution of alms, unless by royal permission; otherwise
the articles thus forbidden will be confiscated.” “<i lang="ms">Puwadi</i> is the ceremony of spreading a cloth, generally a white one, for funeral and other
processions to walk upon. Should the deceased be of high rank, the cloth extends from
the house where the corpse is deposited, to the burial-ground.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2821src" href="#xd32e2821">39</a>
</p>
<p>Similar prohibitions are still in force at the courts of the Malay Sultans in the
Peninsula, though a yellow umbrella is now generally substituted for the white, at
least in Selangor.
</p>
<p>A distinction is also now drawn between manufactured yellow cloth and cloth which
has been dyed yellow with saffron, the wrongful use of the latter (the genuine article)
being regarded as the more especially heinous act.
</p>
<p>In addition to the royal monopoly of such objects <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>as have been mentioned, Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell mentions three royal perquisites (<i lang="ms">larangan raja</i>), <i>i.e.</i> river turtles (<i lang="ms">tuntong</i>) (by which he no doubt means their eggs); elephants (by which he doubtless means
elephants’ tusks);<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2841src" href="#xd32e2841">40</a> and the fruit of the “<i lang="ms">kĕtiar</i>” from which oil is made by the Perak Malays. He adds, “It used to be a capital offence
to give false information to the Raja about any of these. The ‘<i lang="ms">kĕtiar</i>’ tree is said to affect certain localities, and is found in groves not mixed with
other trees. In former days, when the fruit was ripe, the whole of the Raja’s household
would turn out to gather it. It is said to yield a very large percentage of oil.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2859src" href="#xd32e2859">41</a>
</p>
<p>The only tree in Ridley’s list<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2869src" href="#xd32e2869">42</a> whose name at all resembles the “<i lang="ms">kĕtiar</i>” is the <i lang="ms">katiak</i>, which is identified as <i lang="la">Acronychia Porteri</i>, Wall (Rutaceæ).
</p>
<p>A description of the gathering of the eggs of river turtles by the royal party in
Perak will be found in <i>Malay Sketches</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2888src" href="#xd32e2888">43</a>
</p>
<p>Besides the above there are not a few linguistic taboos connected with the king’s
person, such as the use of the words <i lang="ms">santap</i>, to eat; <i lang="ms">bĕradu</i>, to sleep; <i lang="ms">bĕrsĕmaiam</i>, to be seated, or to “reside” in a certain place; <i lang="ms">bĕrangkat</i>, to “progress”; <i lang="ms">siram</i>, to bathe; <i lang="ms">g’ring</i>, to be sick; and <i lang="ms">mangkat</i>, to die; all of which words are specially substituted for the ordinary Malay words
when reference is made to the king.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2917src" href="#xd32e2917">44</a> Moreover, when the king dies his name is <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>dropped, and he receives the title of “Marhum,” the late or “deceased,” with the addition
of an expression alluding to some prominent fact in his life, or occasionally to the
place of his decease. These titles, strange as it may seem, are often the reverse
of complimentary, and occasionally ridiculous.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2958src" href="#xd32e2958">45</a>
</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten, too, in discussing the divine attributes of the Malay king,
that he is firmly believed to possess a personal influence over the works of nature,
such as the growth of the crops and the bearing of fruit-trees. This same property
is supposed to reside in a lesser degree in his delegates, and even in the persons
of Europeans in charge of districts. Thus I have frequently known (in Selangor) the
success or failure of the rice crops attributed to a change of district officers,
and in one case I even heard an outbreak of ferocity which occurred among man-eating
crocodiles laid at the door of a most zealous and able, though perhaps occasionally
somewhat unsympathetic, representative of the Government. So, too, on one <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>occasion when three deaths occurred during a District Officer’s temporary absence,
the mere fact of his absence was considered significant. I may add that royal blood
is supposed by many Malays to be white, and this is the pivot on which the plot of
not a few Malay folk-tales is made to turn.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2974src" href="#xd32e2974">46</a>
</p>
<p>Finally, it must be pointed out that the greatest possible importance is attached
to the method of saluting the king.
</p>
<p>In the “Sri Rama” (the Malay Ramayana) we read, even of the <i>chiefs</i>, that—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“While yet some way off they bowed to the dust,
</p>
<p class="line">When they got near they made obeisance,
</p>

<p class="first">Equals in rank when saluting one another touch<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3015src" href="#xd32e3015">49</a> (though they do not shake) each other’s hands, but a person of humble birth must
not touch hands in saluting a great chief. “A man, named Imam Bakar, was once slain
at Pasir Tambang, at the mouth of the Tĕmbĕling river. He incautiously touched hands
in greeting with a Chief called To’ Gajah, and the latter, seizing him in an iron
grip, held him fast, while he was stabbed to death with spears.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3020src" href="#xd32e3020">50</a>
</p>
<p>In saluting a great Chief, like the Dato’ Maharaja Pĕrba Jĕlai, the hands are “lifted
up in salutation with the palms pressed together, as in the attitude of Christian
prayer, but the tips of the thumbs are <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>not suffered to ascend beyond the base of the chin. In saluting a real Râja, the hands
are carried higher and higher, according to the prince’s rank, until, for the Sultân,
the tips of the thumbs are on a level with the forehead. Little details such as these
are of immense importance in the eyes of the Malays, and not without reason, seeing
that in an Independent Native State many a man has come by his death for carelessness
in their observance.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3029src" href="#xd32e3029">51</a>
</p>
<p>In the king’s audience hall the formal salutations are performed in a sitting posture,
and in this case, too, the greatest attention is paid to the height to which the hands
are raised. The chief twice makes salutation in a sitting posture as he advances,
and at the third advance bends over the Sultan’s hands, two more salutations being
made on his way back to his place.
</p>
<p>A flagrant infringement of any of the prerogatives of the Sultan, such as those I
have described, is certain, it is thought, to prove fatal, more or less immediately.
</p>
<p>Thus the death of Pĕnghulu Mohit, a well-known Malay headman of the Klang district,
in Selangor, which took place while I was in charge of that district, was at the time
very generally attributed by the local Malays to his usurpation of certain royal privileges
or prerogatives on the occasion of his daughter’s wedding. One of these was his acceptance
of gift-buffaloes, <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>decorated after the royal fashion, which were presented to him as wedding gifts in
his daughter’s honour. These buffaloes had a covering of cloth put over them, their
horns covered, and a crescent-shaped breast-ornament (<i lang="ms">dokoh</i>) hung about their necks. Thus dressed they were taken to Mohit’s house in solemn
procession.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3046src" href="#xd32e3046">52</a> It was, at the time, considered significant that the very first of these gift-buffaloes,
which had been brought overland from Jugra, where the Sultan lived, had died on arrival,
and whatever the cause may have been, it is a fact that Mohit’s mother died a day
or two after the conclusion of the wedding ceremonies, and that Mohit himself was
taken ill almost immediately and died only about a fortnight later.
</p>
<p>The only person who, in former days, was not in the least affected by the royal taboos
which protected the regalia from the common touch was the (now I believe extinct)
official who held the post of Court Physician (Maharaja Lela). He, and he alone, might
go freely in the royal apartments wherever he chose, and the immunity and freedom
which he enjoyed in this respect passed into a proverb, the expression “to act the
Court Physician” (<i lang="ms">buat Maharaja Lela</i>) being used to describe an altogether unwarrantable familiarity or impertinence.
</p>
<p>The following story (though I tell it against myself) is perhaps the best illustration
I can give of the great danger supposed to be incurred by those who meddle with the
paraphernalia of royalty. Among the late Sultan’s insignia of royalty (in 1897) were
a couple of <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>drums (<i lang="ms">gĕndang</i>) and the long silver trumpet which I have already described. Such trumpets are found
among the <i lang="ms">kabĕsaran</i> or regalia of most Malay States, and are always, I believe, called <i lang="ms">lĕmpiri</i> or <i lang="ms">nĕmpiri</i> (Pers. <i lang="ms">nafiri</i>). They are considered so sacred that they can only be handled or sounded, it is believed,
by a tribe of Malays called “Orang Kalau,” or the “Kalau men,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3074src" href="#xd32e3074">53</a> as any one else who attempted to sound them would be struck dead. Even the “Orang
Kalau,” moreover, can only sound this instrument at the proper time and season (<i>e.g.</i> at the proclamation of a new sovereign), for if they were to sound it at any other
time its noise would slay all who heard it, since it is the chosen habitation of the
“Jin Karaja’an” or State Demon,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3089src" href="#xd32e3089">54</a> whose delight it would be, if wrongfully disturbed, to slay and spare not.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3129src" href="#xd32e3129">55</a>

</p>
<p><i>Page 40.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>This trumpet and the drums of the Selangor regalia were kept by the present Sultan
(then Raja Muda, or Crown Prince of Selangor) in a small galvanised <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>iron cupboard which stood (upon posts about three feet high) in the middle of a lawn
outside His Highness’ “garden residence” at Bandar. His Highness himself informed
me that they had once been kept in the house itself, but when there they were the
source of infinite annoyance and anxiety to the inmates on account of their very uncanny
behaviour!
</p>
<p>Drops of perspiration, for instance, would form upon the Trumpet when a leading member
of the Royal House was about to die (this actually happened, as I was told, at Langat
just before the death of Tungku ’Chik, the late Sultan’s eldest daughter, who died
during my residence in the neighbourhood). Then one Raja Bakar, son of a Raja ʿAli,
during the rethatching of the house at Bandar, accidentally trod upon the wooden barrel
of one of the State Drums—and <i>died in consequence of his inadvertence</i>. When, therefore, a hornet’s nest formed inside one of these same drums it was pretty
clear that things were going from bad to worse, and a <i>Chinaman</i> was ordered to remove it, no Malay having been found willing to risk his life in
undertaking so dangerous an office—an unwillingness which was presently justified,
as the Chinaman, too, after a few days’ interval, <i>swelled up and died</i>. Both these strange coincidences were readily confirmed by the present Sultan on
an occasion when I happened to question the authenticity of the story, and as His
Highness is one of the most enlightened and truthful of men, such confirmation cannot
easily be set aside. But the strangest coincidence of all was to follow, for not long
afterwards, having never seen that portion of the regalia which was in the Raja Muda’s
charge, I happened to mention to a Malay friend of mine at Jugra my wish to be allowed
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>examine these objects, and was at once begged not to touch them, on the ground that
“no one could say what might follow.” But shortly after, having occasion to visit
the Raja Muda at his house at Bandar, I took the opportunity of asking whether there
was any objection to my seeing these much debated objects, and as His Highness not
only very obligingly assented, but offered to show them to me himself, I was able
both to see and to handle them, His Highness himself taking the Trumpet out of its
yellow case and handing it to me. I thought nothing more of the matter at the time,
but, by what was really a very curious coincidence, within a few days’ time of the
occurrence, was seized with a sharp attack of malarial influenza, the result of which
was that I was obliged to leave the district, and go into hospital at headquarters.
In a Malay village news spreads quickly, and the report of my indisposition, after
what was no doubt regarded as an act of extraordinary rashness, appears to have made
a profound impression, and the result of it was that a Malay who probably considered
himself indebted to me for some assistance he had received, bound himself by a vow
to offer sacrifice at the shrine of a famous local saint should I be permitted to
return to the district. Of this, however, I knew nothing at the time, and nothing
could have exceeded my astonishment when I found upon my return that it was my duty
to attend the banquet which took place at the saint’s tomb in honour of my own recovery!<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3167src" href="#xd32e3167">56</a>
</p>
<p>Having shown the wide gulf which divides the <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>“divine man” from his fellows, I have still to point out the extent to which certain
portions of the human frame have come to be invested with sanctity, and to require
to be treated with special ceremonies. These parts of the anatomy are, in particular,
the head, the hair, the teeth, the ears, and the nails, all of which I will take in
their order.
</p>
<p>The head, in the first place, is undoubtedly still considered by the Malays to possess
some modified degree of sanctity. A proof of this is the custom (<i lang="ms">ʿadat</i>) which regulates the extent of the sacrifice to be offered in a case of assault or
battery by the party committing the injury. If any part of the head is injured, nothing
less than a goat will suffice (the animal being killed and both parties bathed in
the blood); if the upper part of the body, the slaughter of a cock (to be disposed
of in a similar way) will be held to be sufficient reparation, and so on, the sacrifice
becoming of less value in proportion as the injured part is farther from the head.
So, too, Mr. Frazer writes: “The … superstition (of the sanctity of the head) exists
among the Malays; for an early traveller reports that in Java people ‘wear nothing
on their heads, and say that nothing must be on their heads, … and if any person were
to put his hand upon their head they would kill him; and they do not build houses
with stories in order that they may not walk over each other’s heads.’ It is also
found in full force throughout Polynesia.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3181src" href="#xd32e3181">57</a>
</p>
<p>From the principle of the sanctity of the head flows, no doubt, the necessity of using
the greatest circumspection <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>during the process of cutting the hair.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3190src" href="#xd32e3190">58</a> Sometimes throughout the whole life of the wearer, and frequently during special
periods, the hair is left uncut. Thus I was told that in former days Malay men usually
wore their hair long, and I myself have seen an instance of this at Jugra in Selangor
in the person of a Malay<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3200src" href="#xd32e3200">59</a> of the old school, who was locally famous on this account. So, too, during the forty
days which must elapse before the purification of a woman after the birth of her child,
the father of the child is forbidden to cut his hair, and a similar abstention is
said to have been formerly incumbent upon all persons either prosecuting a journey
or engaging in war. Often a boy’s head is entirely shaven shortly after birth with
the exception of a single lock in the centre of the head, and so maintained until
the boy begins to grow up, but frequently the operation is postponed (generally, it
is said, in consequence of a vow made by the child’s parents) until the period of
puberty or marriage. Great care, too, must be exercised in disposing of the clippings
of hair (more especially the <i>first</i> clippings), as the Malay profoundly believes that “the sympathetic connection which
exists between himself and every part <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>of his body continues to exist even after the physical connection has been severed,
and that therefore he will suffer from any harm that may befall the severed parts
of his body, such as the clippings of his hair or the parings of his nails. Accordingly
he takes care that those severed portions of himself shall not be left in places where
they might either be exposed to accidental injury, or fall into the hands of malicious
persons who might work magic on them to his detriment or death.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3232src" href="#xd32e3232">60</a>
</p>
<p>Thus we invariably find clippings of the victim’s hair mentioned (together with parings
of his nails, etc.) as forming part of the ingredients of the well-known wax image
or mannikin into which pins are stuck, and which is still believed by all Malays to
be a most effective method of causing the illness or death of an enemy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3239src" href="#xd32e3239">61</a> I was once present at the curious ceremony of cutting the hair of a Malay bride,
which had all the characteristics of a religious rite, but the detailed account of
it will be reserved for a later chapter.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3245src" href="#xd32e3245">62</a>
</p>
<p>The same difficulties and dangers which beset the first cutting of the hair apply,
though perhaps in a less degree, to the first paring of the nails (<i lang="ms">bĕrtobak</i>), the boring of the ears of girls (<i lang="ms">bĕrtindek tĕlinga</i>), and the filing of the teeth (<i lang="ms">bĕrasah gigi</i>) of either sex whether at puberty or marriage. One or more of the nails are frequently
worn long by Malays of standing, and the women who engage in “nautch” dancing and
theatrical performances invariably wear a complete set of artificial nails (<i lang="ms">changgei</i>). These latter are usually of brass, are often several inches in length, and are
made so <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>as to fit on to the tips of the fingers. Occasionally a brass ring with a small peacock,
or some such bird, of the same material will be attached to the end of the nail by
a minute brass chain. The practice of wearing long nails is sometimes attributed to
Chinese influence, but it is hard to see why this particular detail of Malay custom,
which is quite in keeping with the general trend of Malay ideas about the person,
should be supposed to be derived from China. The borrowing, if any, is much more likely
to have been on the part of the Chinese, who undoubtedly imported many Indian ideas
along with Buddhism. The custom appears to be followed, moreover, in many places,
such as the interior of Sumatra, where Chinese influence is non-existent. In Siam,
again, it appears to obtain very strongly;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3267src" href="#xd32e3267">63</a> but no reason has yet been shown for supposing that this is anything but an instance
of the similarity of results independently arrived at by nations starting with similar
premisses.
</p>
<p>The ear-boring and tooth-filing ceremonies which still not infrequently take place
at the age of puberty in both sexes are of no less religious import than the rite
of cutting the first lock. The main details of these ceremonies will be described
in a later part of this book.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3279src" href="#xd32e3279">64</a>
</p>
<p>To the same category (of sacred things having physical connection with the body) should
doubtless be referred such objects as the eyebrows, the saliva, and soil taken from
the (naked) footstep, all of which are utilised by the magician to achieve his nefarious
ends.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">(<i>c</i>)</span> <i>The Soul</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Malay conception of the Human Soul (<i lang="ms">Sĕmangat</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3299src" href="#xd32e3299">65</a> is that of a species of “Thumbling,” “a thin, unsubstantial human image,” or mannikin,
which is temporarily absent from the body in sleep, trance, disease, and permanently
absent after death.
</p>
<p>This mannikin, which is usually invisible but is supposed to be about as big as the
thumb, corresponds exactly in shape, proportion, and even in complexion, to its embodiment
or casing (<i lang="ms">sarong</i>), <i>i.e.</i> the body in which it has its residence. It is of a “vapoury, shadowy, or filmy” essence,
though not so impalpable but that it may cause displacement on entering a physical
object, and as it can “fly” or “flash” quickly from place to place, it is often, perhaps
metaphorically, addressed as if it were a bird.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3320src" href="#xd32e3320">66</a>
</p>
<p>Thus in a charm given in the Appendix we find—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Hither, Soul, come hither!
</p>
<p class="line">Hither, Little One, come hither!
</p>
<p class="line">Hither, Bird, come hither!
</p>
<p class="line">Hither, Filmy One, come hither!”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3341src" href="#xd32e3341">67</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">As this mannikin is the exact reproduction in every way of its bodily counterpart,
and is “the cause of life and thought in the individual it animates,” it may readily
be endowed with quasi-human feelings, and “independently possess the personal consciousness
and volition of <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>its corporeal owner.” Thus we find the following appeal addressed to the soul in the
charm just quoted:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Do not bear grudges,
</p>
<p class="line">Do not bear malice,
</p>
<p class="line">Do not take it as a wrong,
</p>
<p class="line">Do not take it as a transgression.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">These quasi-human attributes of the soul being so complete, it is an easy stretch
of the imagination to provide it with a house, which is generally in practice identified
with the body of its owner, but may also be identified with any one of its temporary
domiciles. Thus in the charm already quoted we read—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Return to your own House and House-ladder,
</p>
<p class="line">To your own House-floor, of which the planks have started,
</p>
<p class="line">And your Roof-thatch ‘starred’ with holes.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The state of disrepair into which the soul’s house (<i>i.e.</i> the sick man’s body) is described as having fallen, is here attributed to the soul’s
absence.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3365src" href="#xd32e3365">68</a> The completeness of this figurative identification of the soul’s “house” with its
owner’s body, and of the soul’s “sheath” or casing with both, is very clearly brought
out in the following lines:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Cluck! cluck! Soul of this sick man, <i>So-and-so</i>!
</p>
<p class="line">Return into the Frame and Body of <i>So-and-so</i>,
</p>
<p class="line">To your own House and House-ladder, to your own Clearing and Yard,
</p>
<p class="line">To your own Parents, to your own Casing.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And this is no mere chance expression, for in another charm the soul is adjured in
these words:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“As you remember your own parents, remember me,
</p>
<p class="line">As you remember your own House and House-ladder, remember me.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3388src" href="#xd32e3388">69</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The soul “appears to men (both waking and asleep) as a phantom separate from the body
of which it bears the likeness,” “manifests physical power,” and walks, sits, and
sleeps:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Cluck! cluck! Soul of <i>So-and-so</i>, come and walk with me,
</p>
<p class="line">Come and sit with me,
</p>
<p class="line">Come and sleep with me, and share my pillow.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3403src" href="#xd32e3403">70</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">It would probably be wrong to assume the foregoing expressions to have always been
merely figurative. Rather, perhaps, we should consider them as part of a singularly
complete and consistent animistic system formerly invented and still held by the Malays.
Again, from the above ideas it follows that if you call a soul in the right way it
will hear and obey you, and you will thus be able either to recall to its owner’s
body a soul which is escaping (<i lang="ms">riang sĕmangat</i>), or to abduct the soul of a person whom you may wish to get into your power (<i lang="ms">mĕngambil sĕmangat orang</i>), and induce it to take up its residence in a specially prepared receptacle, such
as (<i>a</i>) a lump of earth which has been sympathetically connected by direct contact with
the body of the soul’s owner, or (<i>b</i>) a wax mannikin so connected by indirect means, or even (<i>c</i>) a cloth which has had no such connection whatever. And when you have succeeded in
getting it into your power the abducted and now imprisoned soul will naturally enjoy
any latitude <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>allowed to (and suffer from any mutilation of) its temporary domicile or embodiment.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3424src" href="#xd32e3424">71</a>
</p>
<p>Every man is supposed (it would appear from Malay charms) to possess seven souls<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3431src" href="#xd32e3431">72</a> in all, or, perhaps, I should more accurately say, a sevenfold soul.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3436src" href="#xd32e3436">73</a> This “septenity in unity” may perhaps be held to explain the remarkable importance
and persistency of the number seven in Malay magic, as for instance the seven twigs
of the birch, and the seven repetitions of the charm (in Soul-abduction<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3441src" href="#xd32e3441">74</a>), the seven betel leaves, the seven nights’ duration of the ceremony, the seven blows
administered to the soul (in other magical and medical ceremonies), and the seven
ears cut for the Rice-soul in reaping.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3445src" href="#xd32e3445">75</a>
</p>
<p>And, finally, it might explain why the lime-branch which is hung up in the mosquito-curtain
(in another form of soul-abduction<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3451src" href="#xd32e3451">76</a>) is required to possess seven fruits on a single stalk, <i>i.e.</i> to ensure there being a separate receptacle for each one of the seven souls.
</p>
<p>At the present day the ordinary Malay talks usually of only a single soul, although
he still keeps up the old phraseology in his charms and charm-books. For the rest,
it would appear that there may be some method in the selection and arrangement of
colours.
</p>
<p>The “lump of earth from the victim’s footprint” used in one form of the soul-abduction
ceremony<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3460src" href="#xd32e3460">77</a> is to <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>be wrapped up in three thicknesses of cloth, which must be red, black, and yellow
respectively, the yellow being outside. Again (in the ceremony of casting out “the
mischief” from a sick man), a white cosmetic is assigned for use in the morning, a
red cosmetic for mid-day, and black for sundown.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3466src" href="#xd32e3466">78</a>
</p>
<p>Now in all, I believe, of what are now called the Federated Malay States, and probably
in all Malay States whatsoever, yellow is the colour used by royalty, whereas the
more exalted and sacred colour, white (with occasional lapses into yellow), has been
adopted by Malay medicine-men as the colour most likely to conciliate the spirits
and demons with whom they have to deal. Thus the soul-cloth, which, by the way, is
always five cubits long (<i lang="ms">lima hasta</i>), is sometimes white and (much more rarely) yellow, and hence in the first instance
just quoted, the yellow cloth, being, next to white, of the colour which is most complimentary
to the demons, is the one which is put outside; and in the second instance, for similar
reasons, the white cosmetic is to be used first.
</p>
<p>The working out of this system, however, must await fresh evidence, and all I would
do now is to emphasise the importance of colour in such investigations, and to urge
the collection of fresh material.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3477src" href="#xd32e3477">79</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hitherto I have treated of human souls only, but animal, mineral, and vegetable souls
will now be briefly discussed. Speaking generally, I believe the soul to be, within
certain limits, conceived as a diminutive but exact counterpart of its own embodiment,
so that an Animal-soul would be like an animal, a Bird-soul like a bird; however,
lower in the scale of creation it would appear that the Tree- or Ore-souls, for instance,
are supposed, occasionally at least, to assume the shape of some animal or bird. Thus
the soul of Eagle-wood is thought to take the shape of a bird, the soul of Tin-ore
that of a buffalo, the Gold-soul that of a deer.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3585src" href="#xd32e3585">80</a> It has, however, always been recognised that the soul may enter other bodies besides
its own, or even bodies of a different kind to its own, and hence these may be only
apparent exceptions to the rule that the soul should be the counterpart of its own
embodiment.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3589src" href="#xd32e3589">81</a>
</p>
<p>“Among races within the limits of savagery, the general doctrine of souls is found
worked out with remarkable breadth and consistency. The souls of animals are recognised
by a natural extension from the theory of human souls; the souls of trees and plants
follow in some vague, partial way, and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>souls of inanimate objects expand the general category to its extremest boundary.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3598src" href="#xd32e3598">82</a>
</p>
<p>To the Malay who has arrived at the idea of a generally animated Nature, but has not
yet learned to draw scientific distinctions, there appears nothing remarkable or unnatural
in the idea of vegetation-souls, or even in that of mineral-souls—rather would he
consider us Europeans illogical and inconsistent were he told that we allowed the
possession of souls to one half of the creation and denied it to the other.
</p>
<p>Realising this, we are prepared to find that the Malay theory of Animism embraces,
at least partially, the human race,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3608src" href="#xd32e3608">83</a> animals<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3612src" href="#xd32e3612">84</a> and birds,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3616src" href="#xd32e3616">85</a> vegetation<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3620src" href="#xd32e3620">86</a> (trees and plants), reptiles and fishes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3624src" href="#xd32e3624">87</a> until its extension to inert objects, such as minerals,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3629src" href="#xd32e3629">88</a> and “stocks and stones, weapons, boats, food, clothes, ornaments, and other objects,
which to us are not merely soulless, but lifeless,” brings us face to face with a
conception with which “we are less likely to sympathise.”
</p>
<p>Side by side with this general conception of an universally animate nature, we find
abundant evidences of a special theory of Human Origin which is held to account not
only for the larger mammals, but also for the existence of a large number of birds,
and even for that of a few reptiles, fishes, trees and plants, but seems to lose its
operative force in proportion to its descent in the scale of creation, until in the
lowest scale of all, the theory of Human Origin disappears <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>from sight, and nothing remains but the partial application of a few vague anthropomorphic
attributes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3637src" href="#xd32e3637">89</a> It is, doubtless, to the prevalence of this theory that we owe the extraordinary
persistence of anthropomorphic ideas about animals, birds, reptiles, trees, if not
of minerals, in Malay magical ceremonies;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3640src" href="#xd32e3640">90</a> and it is hard to say which of these two notions—the theory of Human Origin, or the
other theory of Universal Animism—is to be considered the original form of Malay belief.
</p>
<p>The following tale, which is entitled <i lang="ms">Charitra Mĕgat Sajobang</i>, and is told by Selangor Malays, will serve as an illustration of the idea of Human
Origin:—
</p>
<p>“There was a married Sakai couple living at Ulu Klang, and they had a son called Mĕgat
Sajobang. When he grew up he said to his mother, ‘Mother, get me a passage, I want
to go and see other countries.’ She did so, and he left Ulu Klang; and ten or twelve
years later, when he had grown rich enough to buy a splendid ship (<i lang="ms">p’rahu</i>), he returned with his wife, who was with child, and seven midwives, who were watched
over by one of his body-guard with a drawn sword. His mother heard the news of his
return, and she made ready, roasting a <i lang="ms">chika</i> (monkey) and <i lang="ms">lotong</i> (monkey), and went with his father on board their bark canoe to meet their son.
</p>
<p>“As they approached they hailed him by his name; but he was ashamed of their humble
appearance, and forbade his men to let them on board. Though his wife advised him
to acknowledge them, ‘even if they <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>were pigs or dogs,’ the unfilial son persisted in turning them away. So they went
back to the shore and sat down and wept; and the old mother, laying her hand upon
her shrivelled breast, said, ‘If thou art really my son, reared at my breast, mayest
thou be changed into stone.’ In response to her prayer, milk came forth from her breast,
and as she walked away, the ship and all on board were turned into stone. The mother
turned round once more to look at her son, but the father did not, and by the power
of God they were both turned into trees of the species <i lang="ms">pauh</i> (a kind of mango) one leaning seawards and the other towards the land. The fruit
of the seaward one is sweet, but that of the landward one is bitter.
</p>
<p>“The ship has now become a hill, and originally was complete with all its furniture,
but the Malays used to borrow the plates and cups, etc., for feast days and did not
return them, until at last there were none left.”

traditions. They say the angels Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil were sent by God, one
after another, to fetch for that purpose seven handfuls of earth from different depths,
and of different colours (whence some account for the various complexions of mankind);
but the Earth being apprehensive of the consequence, and desiring them to represent
her fear to God that the creature He designed to form would rebel against Him, and
draw down His curse upon her, they returned without performing God’s command; whereupon
He sent Azrael on the same errand, who executed his commission without remorse, for
which reason God appointed that angel to separate the souls from the bodies, being
therefore called <i>the angel of death</i>. The earth he had taken was carried into Arabia, to a place between Mecca and Tayef,
where, being first kneaded by the angels, it was afterwards fashioned by God himself
into a human form, and left to dry for the space of forty days, or, as others say,
as many years, the angels in the meantime often visiting it, and Eblis (then one of
the angels who are nearest to God’s presence, afterwards the devil) among the rest;
but he, not contented with looking on it, kicked it with his foot till it rung, and
knowing God designed that creature to be his superior, took a secret resolution never to acknowledge him as such. After this God
animated the figure of clay and endued it with an intelligent soul, and when He had
placed him in paradise, formed Eve out of his left side.”—Sale’s <i>Korân</i>, ch. ii. (of translation), p. 4 (note).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e2062src" title="Return to note 11 in text.">↑</a></p>

pretensions to sanctity which to this day (with, in some parts, no great diminution)
hedge about the person of the Malay king:—
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“The Sultan of <i>Menangcabow</i>, whose residence is at <i>Pagarooyoong</i> (after pardon asked for presuming to mention his name), who is king of kings, son
of <i>Raja Iscunder-zulcarnainny</i>, … master of the third of the wood <i>maccummat</i>, one of whose properties is to enable matter to fly; of the lance ornamented with
the beard of <i>Jangee</i>, of the palace of the city of Rome; … of the gold of twelve grains named <i>coodarat coodarattee</i>, resembling a man; … who is possessed of the sword named <i>Chooree-se-mendong-geree</i>, which has an hundred and ninety gaps, made in the conflict with the arch-devil,
<i>Se Cattee-moono</i>, whom it slew; who is master of fresh water in the ocean, to the extent of a day’s
sailing; possessed of a lance formed of a twig of <i>ejoo</i> (the <i>gomuti</i>, or sugar-palm); of a <i>calewang</i> (scimitar) wrapped in an unmade <i>chinday</i> (cloth); of a <i>creese</i> (dagger) formed of the soul of steel, which, by a noise, expresses an unwillingness
at being sheathed, and shows itself pleased when drawn; of a date coeval with the
creation; possessed of a gun brought from heaven, named <i>soubahana hou ouatanalla</i>; of a horse of the race of <i>sorimbor-ahnee</i>, superior to all others; Sultan of the Burning Mountain, and of the mountains <i>goontang-goontang</i>, which divide <i>Palembang</i> and <i>Jambee</i>; who may slay at pleasure without being guilty of a crime; who is possessed of the
elephant named <i>settee dewa</i>; who is Vicegerent of Heaven; Sultan of the Golden River; Lord of the Air and Clouds;
master of a <i>balli</i> (Audience-Hall), whose pillars are of the shrub <i>jelattang</i>; of <i>gandangs</i> (drums) made of hollowed branches of the minute shrubs <i>pooloot</i> and <i>seelosooree</i>; of the <i>gong</i> that resounds to the skies; of the buffalo named <i>Se Binnooang Sattee</i>, whose horns are ten feet asunder; of the unconquered cock, <i>Sengonannee</i>; of the cocoa-nut tree whose amazing height, and being infested with serpents and
other noxious reptiles, render it impossible to be climbed; of the flower named <i>seeree menjeree</i>, of ambrosial scent; who, when he goes to sleep, wakes not till the <i>gandang nobat</i> (state drum) sounds; one of whose eyes is as the sun and the other as the moon.”—Marsden,
<i>Hist. of Sum.</i> p. 270.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">On the foregoing list I should like to remark (1) that the necessity of asking pardon
for mentioning the king’s name is considered by the Peninsular Malays to be as imperative
as ever. (2) The expression “who is master of fresh water in the ocean” is explained
by a passage in Leyden’s <i>Malay Annals</i> (p. 37), where, all the fresh water being exhausted, “Raja Sang Sapurba directed
them to bring rotans and tie them in circles and throw them in the water; then having
himself descended into a small boat, he inserted his feet into the water, within the
circles of bamboo (<i>sic</i>), and by the Power of God Almighty and the virtue of a descendant of Raja Secander Zulkarneini,
the water within these circles became fresh, and all the crews supplied themselves
with it, and unto this day the fresh water is mixed with the salt at this place.”
(3) The horse, which is usually called “Sĕmbrani,” is a magic steed, “which could
fly through the air as well as swim through the water” (Leyd., <i>Mal. Ann.</i> p. 17). (4) For the mountains Goontang-goontang (or Saguntang Mahamiru), cp. Leyden’s
<i>Mal. Ann.</i> p. 20 <i>seqq.</i> (5) The privilege of “slaying at pleasure without being guilty of a crime” is a privilege
which still belongs to Malay sovereigns of the first rank.

Allum”(GegarʿAlam), “were a sacred crown from God”; “the cloth <i lang="ms">sansistah kallah</i>, which weaves itself, and adds one thread yearly of fine pearls, and when that cloth
shall be finished the world will be no more”; “the dagger <i>Hangin Cinga</i> (Singa?) which will, at his command, fight of itself”; “the blue champaka flower,
which is to be found in no country but his (being yellow elsewhere),” and many others
worthy of the Sultan “whose presence bringeth death to all who attempt to approach
him without permission,” and of the “Sultan of Indrapore, who has four breasts.”—Marsden,

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e2958src">45</a></span> <i>Marhum</i>, one who has found mercy, <i>i.e.</i> the deceased. It is the custom of Malays to discontinue after the death of a king
the use of the title which he bore during his life. A new title is invented for the
deceased monarch, by which he is ever afterwards known. The existence of a similar
custom among other Indo-Chinese races has been noticed by Colonel Yule: “There is
also a custom of dropping or concealing the proper name of the king. This exists in
Burma and (according to La Loubère) in Siam. The various kings of those countries
are generally distinguished by some nickname derived from facts in their reign or
personal relations, <i>and applied to them after their decease</i>. Thus we hear among the Burmese kings of ‘the king dethroned by foreigners,’ ‘the
king who fled from the Chinese,’ ‘the grandfather king,’ and even ‘the king thrown
into the water.’ Now this has a close parallel in the Archipelago. Among the kings
of Macassar, we find one king known only as the ‘Throat-cutter’; another as ‘He who
ran amuck’; a third, ‘The beheaded’; a fourth, ‘He who was beaten to death on his
own stair-case.’ ” Colonel Yule ascribes the origin of this custom to Ancient India.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The accredited intermediary between men and spirits is the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3689src" href="#xd32e3689">1</a> the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> is a functionary of great and traditional importance in a Malay village, though in
places near towns the office is falling into abeyance. In the inland districts, however,
the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> is still a power, and is regarded as part of the constituted order of society, without
whom no village community would be complete. It must be clearly understood that he
has nothing whatever to do with the official Muhammadan religion of the mosque; the
village has its regular staff of elders—the <i lang="ms">Imām</i>, <i lang="ms">Khatib</i>, and <i lang="ms">Bilal</i>—for the mosque service. But the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> is quite outside this system, and belongs to a different and much older order of
ideas; he may be regarded as the legitimate representative of the primitive ‘medicine-man’
or ‘village-sorcerer,’ and his very existence in these days is an anomaly, though
it does not strike Malays as such.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Very often the office is hereditary, or at least the appointment is practically confined
to the members of one family. Sometimes it is endowed with certain ‘properties’ handed
down from one <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> to his successor, known as the <i lang="ms">kabĕsaran</i>, or, as it were, regalia. On one occasion I was nearly called upon to decide whether
these adjuncts—which consisted, in this particular case, of a peculiar kind of head-dress—were
the personal property of the person then in possession of them (who had got them from
his father, a deceased <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>), or were to be regarded as official insignia descending with the office in the event
of the natural heir declining to serve! Fortunately I was spared the difficult task
of deciding this delicate point of law, as I managed to persuade the owner to take
up the appointment.
</p>
<p>“But quite apart from such external marks of dignity, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> is a person of very real significance. In all agricultural operations, such as sowing,
reaping, irrigation works, and the clearing of jungle for planting, in fishing at
sea, in prospecting for minerals, and in cases of sickness, his assistance is invoked.
He is entitled by custom to certain small fees; thus, after a good harvest he is allowed,
in some villages, five <i lang="ms">gantangs</i> of padi, one <i lang="ms">gantang</i> of rice (<i lang="ms">bĕras</i>), and two <i lang="ms">chupaks</i> of <i lang="ms">ĕmping</i> (a preparation of rice and cocoa-nut made into a sort of sweetmeat) from each householder.
After recovery from sickness his remuneration is the very modest amount of <i lang="ms">tiga wang baharu</i>, that is, 7½ cents.
</p>
<p>“It is generally believed that a good harvest can only be secured by complying with
his instructions, which are of a peculiar and comprehensive character.
</p>
<p>“They consist largely of prohibitions, which are <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>known as <i lang="ms">pantang</i>. Thus, for instance, it is <i lang="ms">pantang</i> in some places to work in the rice-field on the 14th and 15th days of the lunar month;
and this rule of enforced idleness, being very congenial to the Malay character, is,
I believe, pretty strictly observed.
</p>
<p>“Again, in reaping, certain instruments are proscribed, and in the inland villages
it is regarded as a great crime to use the sickle (<i lang="ms">sabit</i>) for cutting the <i lang="ms">padi</i>; at the very least the first few ears should be cut with a <i lang="ms">tuai</i>, a peculiar small instrument consisting of a semicircular blade set transversely
on a piece of wood or bamboo, which is held between the fingers, and which cuts only
an ear or two at a time. Also the <i lang="ms">padi</i> must not be threshed by hitting it against the inside of a box, a practice known
as <i lang="ms">banting padi</i>.
</p>
<p>“In this, as in one or two other cases, it may be supposed that the <i lang="ms">Pawang’s</i> ordinances preserve the older forms of procedure and are opposed to innovations in
agricultural methods. The same is true of the <i lang="ms">pantang</i> (<i>i.e.</i> taboo) rule which prescribes a fixed rate of price at which <i lang="ms">padi</i> may be sold in the village community to members of the same village. This system
of customary prices is probably a very old relic of a time when the idea of asking
a neighbour or a member of your own tribe to pay a competition price for an article
was regarded as an infringement of communal rights. It applies to a few other articles
of local produce<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3791src" href="#xd32e3791">2</a> besides <i lang="ms">padi</i>, and I was frequently assured <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>that the neglect of this wholesome rule was the cause of bad harvests. I was accordingly
pressed to fine transgressors, which would perhaps have been a somewhat difficult
thing to do. The fact, however, that in many places these rules are generally observed
is a tribute to the influence of the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> who lends his sanction to them.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3855src" href="#xd32e3855">3</a>
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> keeps a familiar spirit, which in his case is a <i lang="ms">hantu pŭsaka</i>, that is, an hereditary spirit which runs in the family, in virtue of which he is
able to deal summarily with the wild spirits of an obnoxious character.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3870src" href="#xd32e3870">4</a>
</p>
<p>The foregoing description is so precise and clear that I have not much to add to it.
There are, however, one or two points which require emphasis. One of these is that
the priestly magician stands in certain respects on the same footing as the divine
man or king—that is to say, he owns certain insignia which are exactly analogous to
the regalia of the latter, and are, as Mr. Blagden points out, called by the same
name (<i lang="ms">kabĕsaran</i>). He shares, moreover, with the king the right to make use of cloth dyed with the
royal colour (yellow), and, like the king, too, possesses the right to enforce the
use of certain ceremonial words and phrases, in which respect, indeed, his list is
longer, if anything, than that of royalty.
</p>
<p>He also acts as a sort of spirit-medium and gives oracles in trances; possesses considerable
political influence; practises (very occasional) austerities; observes some degree
of chastity, and appears quite sincere in his conviction of his own powers. At least
he always has a most plausible excuse ready to account for his <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>inability to do whatever is required. An aged magician who came from Perak to doctor
one of H.H. the Sultan’s sons (Raja Kahar) while I was at Langat, had the unusual
reputation of being able to raise a sandbank in the sea at will; but when I asked
if I could see it done, he explained that it could only be done in time of war when
he was hard pressed by an enemy’s boat, and he could not do it for the sake of mere
ostentation! Moreover, like members of their profession all the world over, these
medicine-men are, perhaps naturally, extremely reticent; it was seldom that they would
let their books be seen, much less copied, even for fair payment, and a Pawang once
refused to tell me a charm until I had taken my shoes off and was seated with him
upon a yellow cloth while he repeated the much-prized formula.
</p>
<p>The office of magician is, as has been said, very often hereditary. It is not so always,
however, there being certain recognised ways in which a man may “get magic.” One of
the most peculiar is as follows: “To obtain magical powers (<i lang="ms">ʿelmu</i>) you must meet the ghost of a murdered man. Take the midrib of a leaf of the ‘ivory’
cocoa-nut palm (<i lang="ms">pĕlĕpah niyor gading</i>), which is to be laid on the grave, and two more midribs, which are intended to represent
canoe-paddles, and carry them with the help of a companion to the grave of the murdered
man at the time of the full moon (the 15th day of the lunar month) when it falls upon
a Tuesday. Then take a cent’s worth of incense, with glowing embers in a censer, and
carry them to the head-post of the grave of the deceased. Fumigate the grave, going
three times round it, and call upon the murdered man by name:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">‘Hearken, <i>So-and-so</i>,
</p>
<p class="line">And assist me;
</p>
<p class="line">I am taking (this boat) to the saints of God,
</p>
<p class="line">And I desire to ask for a little magic.’<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3902src" href="#xd32e3902">5</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here take the first midrib, fumigate it, and lay it upon the head of the grave, repeating
‘<i lang="ms">Kur Allah</i>’ (‘Cluck, cluck, God!’) seven times. You and your companion must now take up a sitting
posture, one at the head and the other at the foot of the grave, facing the grave
post, and use the canoe-paddles which you have brought. In a little while the surrounding
scenery will change and take upon itself the appearance of the sea, and finally an
aged man will appear, to whom you must address the same request as before.”

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">(<i>b</i>)</span> <i>High Places</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Although officially the religious centre of the village community is the mosque,
there is usually in every small district a holy place known as the <i lang="ms">kramat</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3942src" href="#xd32e3942">6</a> at which vows are paid on special occasions, and which is invested with a very high
degree of reverence and sanctity.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>“These <i lang="ms">kramats</i> abound in Malacca territory; there is hardly a village but can boast some two or
three in its immediate neighbourhood, and they are perfectly well known to all the
inhabitants.
</p>
<p>“Theoretically, <i lang="ms">kramats</i> are supposed to be the graves of deceased holy men, the early apostles of the Muhammadan
faith, the first founders of the village who cleared the primeval jungle, or other
persons of local notoriety in a former age; and there is no doubt that many of them
are that and nothing more. But even so, the reverence paid to them and the ceremonies
that are performed at them savour a good deal too much of ancestor-worship to be attributable
to an orthodox Muhammadan origin.
</p>
<p>“It is certain, however, that many of these <i lang="ms">kramats</i> are not graves at all: many of them are in the jungle, on hills and in groves, like
the high places of the Old Testament idolatries; they contain no trace of a grave
(while those that are found in villages usually have grave-stones), and they appear
to be really ancient sites of a primitive nature-worship or the adoration of the spirits
of natural objects.
</p>
<p>“Malays, when asked to account for them, often have recourse to the explanations that
they are <i lang="ms">kramat jin</i>, that is, “spirit”-places; and if a Malay is pressed on the point, and thinks that
the orthodoxy of these practices is being impugned, he will sometimes add that the
<i lang="ms">jin</i> in question is a <i lang="ms">jin islām</i>, a Muhammadan and quite orthodox spirit!
</p>
<p>“Thus on Bukit Nyalas, near the Johol frontier, there is a <i lang="ms">kramat</i> consisting of a group of granite boulders on a ledge of rock overhanging a sheer
descent of a good many feet; bamboo clumps grow on the place, and there were traces
of religious rites having <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>been performed there, but no grave whatever. This place was explained to me to be
the <i lang="ms">kramat</i> of one Nakhoda Hussin, described as a <i lang="ms">jin</i> (of the orthodox variety), who presides over the water, rain, and streams. People
occasionally burned incense there to avert drought and get enough water for irrigating
their fields. There was another <i lang="ms">kramat</i> of his lower down the hill, also consisting of rocks, one of which was shaped something
like a boat. I was informed that this <i lang="ms">jin</i> is attended by tigers which guard the hill, and are very jealous of the intrusion
of other tigers from the surrounding country. He is believed to have revealed himself
to the original <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> of the village, the mythical founder of the <i lang="ms">kampong</i> of Nyalas. In a case like this it seems probable that the name attached to this object
of reverence is a later accretion, and that under a thin disguise we have here a relic
of the worship of the spirit of rivers and streams, a sort of elemental deity localised
in this particular place, and still regarded as a proper object of worship and propitiation,
in spite of the theoretically strict monotheism of the Muhammadan creed. Again, at
another place the <i lang="ms">kramat</i> is nothing but a tree, of somewhat singular shape, having a large swelling some way
up the trunk. It was explained to me that this tree was connected in a special way
with the prospects of local agriculture, the size of the swelling increasing in good
years and diminishing in bad seasons! Hence it was naturally regarded with considerable
awe by the purely agricultural population of the neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>“As may be imagined, it is exceedingly difficult to discover any authentic facts regarding
the history of these numerous <i lang="ms">kramats</i>: even where there is some evidence of the existence of a grave, the name of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>departed saint is usually the one fact that is remembered, and often even that is
forgotten. The most celebrated of the Malacca <i lang="ms">kramats</i>, the one at Machap, is a representative type of the first class, that in which there
really is a grave: it is the one place where a hardened liar respects the sanctity
of an oath, and it is occasionally visited in connection with civil cases, when the
one party challenges the other to take a particular oath. A man who thinks nothing
of perjuring himself in the witness-box, and who might not much mind telling a lie
even with the Korān on his head, will flinch before the ordeal of a falsehood in the
presence of the Dato’ Machap.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4031src" href="#xd32e4031">7</a>
</p>
<p>After explaining the difference between beneficent spirits and the spirits of evil,
Mr. Blagden continues: “Some time ago one of these objectionable <i lang="ms">hantus</i> (spirits of evil) had settled down in a <i lang="ms">kĕrayong</i> tree in the middle of this village of Bukit Sĕnggeh, and used to frighten people
who passed that way in the dusk; so the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> was duly called upon to exorcise it, and under his superintendence the tree was cut
down, after which there was no more trouble. But it is certain that it would have
been excessively dangerous for an ordinary layman to do so.
</p>
<p>“This point may be illustrated by a case which was reported to me soon after it occurred,
and which again shows the intimate connection of spirits with trees. A Javanese coolie,
on the main road near Ayer Panas, cut down a tree which was known to be occupied by
a <i lang="ms">hantu</i>. He was thereupon seized with what, from the description, appears to have been an
epileptic fit, and showed all the traditional symptoms of demoniac <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>possession. He did not recover till his friends had carried out the directions of
the spirit, speaking through the sufferer’s mouth, it seems, viz., to burn incense,
offer rice, and release a fowl. After which the <i lang="ms">hantu</i> left him.
</p>
<p>“In many places there are trees which are pretty generally believed to be the abodes
of spirits, and not one Malay in ten would venture to cut one down, while most people
would hardly dare to go near one after dark. On one occasion an exceptionally intelligent
Malay, with whom I was discussing the terms on which he proposed to take up a contract
for clearing the banks of a river, made it an absolute condition that he should not
be compelled to cut down a particular tree which overhung the stream, on the ground
that it was a ‘spirit’ tree. That tree had to be excluded from the contract.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4061src" href="#xd32e4061">8</a>

<p>The following description, by Sir W. Maxwell, of a Perak <i lang="ms">kramat</i> may be taken as fairly typical of the <i lang="ms">kramat</i>, in which there really is a grave:—
</p>
<p>“Rightly or wrongly the Malays of Larut assign an Achinese origin to an old grave
which was discovered in the forest some years ago, and of which I propose to give
a brief description. It is situated about half-way between the Larut Residency and
the mining village of Kamunting. In the neighbourhood the old durian trees of Java
betoken the presence of a Malay population at a date long prior to the advent of the
Chinese miner. The grave was discovered about twenty years ago by workmen employed
by the Mĕntri of Perak to make the Kamunting road, and it excited much curiosity among
the Malays at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>time. The Mĕntri and all the ladies of his family went on elephants to see it, and
it has been an object of much popular prestige ever since.
</p>
<p>“The Malays of Java were able from the village tradition to give the name and sex
of the occupant of this lonely tomb, ‘Toh Bidan Susu Lanjut,’ whose name sounds better
in the original than in an English translation. She is said to have been an old Achinese
woman of good family; of her personal history nothing is known, but her claims to
respectability are evinced by the carved head and foot stones of Achinese workmanship
which adorn her grave, and her sanctity is proved by the fact that the stones are
eight feet apart. It is a well-known Malay superstition that the stones placed to
mark the graves of Saints miraculously increase their relative distance during the
lapse of years, and thus bear mute testimony to the holiness of the person whose resting-place
they mark.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">kramat</i> on the Kamunting road is on the spur of a hill through which the roadway is cut.
A tree overshadows the grave and is hung with strips of white cloth and other rags
(<i lang="ms">panji panji</i>) which the devout have put there. The direction of the grave is as nearly as possible
due north and south. The stones at its head and foot are of the same size, and in
every respect identical one with the other. They are of sandstone, and are said by
the natives to have been brought from Achin. In design and execution they are superior
to ordinary Malay art, as will be seen, I think, on reference to the rubbings of the
carved surface of one of them, which have been executed for me by the Larut Survey
Office, and which I have transmitted to the Society with this paper. The extreme measurements
of the stones (furnished from <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>the same source) are 2′ 1″ × 0′ 9″ × 0′ 7″. They are in excellent preservation, and
the carving is fresh and sharp. Some Malays profess to discover in the three rows
of vertical direction on the broadest face of the slabs the Mohammedan attestation
of the unity of God (<i lang="ms">La ilaha illa-lla</i>) repeated over and over again; but I confess that I have been unable to do so. The
offerings at a <i lang="ms">kramat</i> are generally incense (<i lang="ms">istangi</i> or <i lang="ms">satangi</i>) or benzoin (<i lang="ms">kaminian</i>); these are burned in little stands made of bamboo rods; one end is stuck in the
ground and the other split into four or five, and then opened out and plaited with
basket work so as to hold a little earth. They are called <i lang="ms">sangka</i>; a Malay will often vow that if he succeeds in some particular project, or gets out
of some difficulty in which he may happen to be placed, he will burn three or more
<i lang="ms">sangka</i> at such and such a <i lang="ms">kramat</i>. Persons who visit a <i lang="ms">kramat</i> in times of distress or difficulty, to pray and to vow offerings, in case their prayers
are granted, usually leave behind them as tokens of their vows small pieces of white
cloth, which are tied to the branches of a tree or to sticks planted in the ground
near the sacred spot. For votary purposes the long-forgotten tomb of Toh Bidan Susu
Lanjut enjoys considerable popularity among the Mohammedans of Larut; and the tree
which overshadows it has, I am glad to say, been spared the fate which awaited the
rest of the jungle which overhung the road. No coolie was bold enough to put an axe
to it.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4121src" href="#xd32e4121">9</a>
</p>
<p>Mr. George Bellamy, writing in 1893, thus described the <i lang="ms">kramat</i> at Tanjong Karang in the Kuala Selangor district:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">kramat</i> about which I am now writing is a very remarkable one. It is situated on the extreme
point of land at the mouth of the river Selangor, close to where the new lighthouse
has been erected. A magnificent <i lang="ms">kayu ara</i> (a kind of fig-tree) forms a prominent feature of the <i lang="ms">tanjong</i> (point or cape), and at the base of this tree, enveloped entirely by its roots, is
an oblong-shaped space having the appearance of a Malay grave, with the headstones
complete.… To this sacred spot constant pilgrimages are made by the Malays, and the
lower branches of the tree rarely lack those pieces of white and yellow cloth which
are always hung up as an indication that some devout person has paid his vows. The
Chinese also have great respect for this <i lang="ms">kramat</i>, and have erected a sort of sylvan temple at the foot of the tree.” Mr. Bellamy tells
how one Raja ʿAbdullah fell in love with a maiden named Miriam, who disappeared and
was supposed to have been taken by the spirits (though she was really carried off
by an earlier lover named Hassan). Raja ʿAbdullah died and was buried at the foot
of the fig-tree. Mr. Bellamy concludes: “If you ever happen to see a very big crocodile
at the mouth of the Selangor river, floating listlessly about, be careful not to molest
it: it is but the <i lang="ms">buaya kramat</i>, which shape the spirit of Raja ʿAbdullah sometimes assumes. When walking along the
<i lang="ms">pantai</i> (shore), if you chance to meet a very large tiger let him pass unharmed. It is only
Raja ʿAbdullah’s ghost, and in proof thereof you will see it leaves no footmarks on
the sand. And when you go to see the new lighthouse at Tanjong Kramat, you may perhaps
come face to face with a very old man, who sadly shakes his head and disappears. <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>Do not be startled, it is only Raja ʿAbdullah.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4156src" href="#xd32e4156">10</a>
</p>
<p>In No. 2 of the same volume of the <i>Selangor Journal</i> Mr. Bellamy refers to another <i lang="ms">kramat</i>—that of ’Toh Kĕtapang—which he appears to localise in Ulu Selangor.
</p>
<p>It is by no means necessary to ensure the popularity of a <i lang="ms">kramat</i> or shrine that the saint to whose memory it is dedicated should be a Malay. The cosmopolitan
character of these shrines is attested in the following note which I sent to the <i>Selangor Journal</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4174src" href="#xd32e4174">11</a> about the shrines in the Ulu Langat (Kajang) district of Selangor:—
</p>
<p>“The chief <i lang="ms">kramats</i> in the district are ‘Makam ’Toh Sayah’ (the tomb of a Javanese of high repute); ‘Makam
Said Idris,’ at Rekoh, Said Idris being the father of the Pĕnghulu of Cheras; ‘Makam
’Toh Janggut<span class="corr" id="xd32e4183" title="Not in source">’</span> (a ‘Kampar’ man), on the road to Cheras; and ‘Makam ’Toh Gerdu or Berdu,’ at Dusun
Tua, Ulu Langat. ’Toh Berdu was of Sakai origin.”
</p>
<p>I have never yet, however, heard of any shrine being dedicated to a Chinaman, and
it is probable that this species of canonisation is confined (at least in modern times)
to local celebrities professing the Muhammadan religion, as would certainly be the
case of the Malays and Javanese mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, and quite possibly
too in the case of the Sakai.
</p>
<p>It is true that Chinese often worship at these shrines—just as, on the same principle,
they employ Malay magicians in prospecting for tin; but there appear to be certain
limits beyond which they <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>cannot go, as it was related to me when I was living in the neighbourhood, that a
Chinaman who had, in the innocence of his heart, <i>offered at a Moslem shrine a piece of the accursed pork</i>, was pounced upon and slain before he reached home by one of the tigers which guarded
the shrine.
</p>
<p>The shrine of ’Toh Kamarong is one of the most celebrated shrines in the Langat district,
the saint’s last resting-place being guarded by a white elephant and a white tiger,
the latter of which had been a pet (<i lang="ms">pĕmainan</i>) of his during his lifetime. In this respect it is exactly similar to the shrine
of ’Toh Parwi of Pantei in Sungei Ujong, which is similarly guarded, both shrines
having been erected on the seashore, it is said, in the days when the sea came much
farther inland than it does at present. The fame of ’Toh Kamarong filled the neighbourhood,
and it is related that on one occasion an irate mother exclaimed, of a son of hers
who was remarkable for his vicious habits, “May the ’Toh Kramat Kamarong fly away
with him.” Next day the boy disappeared, and all search proved fruitless, until three
days later ’Toh Kamarong appeared to her in a dream, and informed her that he had
carried the boy off, as she had invited him to do, and that if she were to look for
his footprints she would be able to discover them inside the pad-tracks of a tiger
one of whose feet was smaller than the rest, and which was then haunting the spot.
She did so, and discovered her son’s footprints exactly as the saint had foretold.
This Ghost-tiger, which no doubt must be identified with ’Toh Kamarong’s “pet,” used
to roam the district when I was stationed in the neighbourhood, and both I and, I
believe, the then District Engineer (Mr. Spearing), saw this tiger’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>tracks, and can vouch for the fact that one footprint was smaller than the rest. This
curious feature is thought by the local Malays at least, to be one of the specially
distinctive marks of a <i lang="ms">rimau kramat</i>, or Ghost-tiger, just as the possession of one tusk that is smaller than the other
is the mark of a Ghost-elephant.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4203src" href="#xd32e4203">12</a>
</p>
<p>Closely connected with the subject of shrines is that of high places, such as those
spots where religious penance was traditionally practised. One of these sacred spots
is said to have been situated upon the “Mount Ophir” of Malacca, which is about 4000
feet high, and on which a certain legendary Princess known as Tuan Pŭtri Gunong Ledang
is said to have dwelt, until she transferred her ghostly court to Jugra Hill, upon
the coast of Selangor.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4209src" href="#xd32e4209">13</a>
</p>
<p>Such fasting-places are usually, as in Java, either solitary hills or places which
present some great natural peculiarity; even remarkable trees and rocks being, as
has already been pointed out, pressed into the service of this Malay “natural religion.”
</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The main divisions of the magico-religious ceremonies of the Malays are prayer, sacrifice,
lustration, fasting, divination, and possession.
</p>
<p>Prayer, which is defined by Professor Tylor as “a request made to a deity as if he
were a man,” is still in the unethical stage among the Malays; no request <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>for anything but personal advantages of a material character being ever, so far as
I am aware, preferred by the worshipper. The efficacy of prayer is, however, often
supposed to be enhanced by repetition.
</p>
<p>“As prayer is a request made to a deity as if he were a man, so sacrifice is a gift
made to a deity as if he were a man.… The ruder conception that the deity takes and
values the offering for itself, gives place, on the one hand, to the idea of mere
homage as expressed by a gift, and, on the other, to the negative view that the virtue
lies in the worshipper depriving himself of something prized.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4232src" href="#xd32e4232">14</a>
</p>
<p>A general survey of the charms and ceremonies brought together in this volume will,
I think, be likely to establish the view that the Malays (in accordance with the reported
practice of many other races) probably commenced with the idea of sacrifice as a simple
gift, and therefrom developed first the idea of ceremonial homage, and later the idea
of sacrifice as an act of abnegation. Evidences of the original gift-theory chiefly
survive in the language of charms, in which the deity appealed to is repeatedly invited
to eat and drink of the offerings placed before him, as a master may be invited to
eat by his servants. The intermediate stage between the gift and homage theories is
marked by an extensive use of “substitutes,” and of the sacrifice of a part or parts
for the whole. Thus we even find the dough model of a human being actually called
“the substitute” (<i lang="ms">tukar ganti</i>), and offered up to the spirits upon the sacrificial tray; in the same sense are
the significant directions of a magician, that “<i>if the spirit craves a human victim a cock may be substituted</i>” and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>custom of hunters who, when they have killed a deer, leave behind them in the forest
small portions of each of the more important members of the deer’s anatomy, as “representatives”
of the entire carcase. In this last case the usual “ritualistic change may be traced
from practical reality to formal ceremony.” “The originally valuable offering is compromised
for a smaller tribute or a cheaper substitute, dwindling at last to a mere trifling
token or symbol.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4246src" href="#xd32e4246">15</a>
</p>
<p>This homage-theory will, I believe, be found to cover by far the greater bulk of the
sacrifices usually offered by Malays, and the idea of abnegation appears to be practically
confined to votal ceremonies or vows (<i lang="ms">niat</i>), in which the nature and extent of the offering are not regulated by custom, but
depend entirely upon the wealth or caprice of the worshipper, there being merely a
tacit understanding that he shall sacrifice something which is of more than nominal
value to himself.
</p>
<p>Of the manner in which offerings are supposed to be received by the deity to whom
they are offered it is difficult to obtain very much evidence. I have, however, frequently
questioned Malays upon this subject, and on the whole think it can very safely be
said that the deity is not supposed to touch the solid or material part of the offering,
but only the essential part, whether it be “life, savour, essence, quality” or even
the “soul.”
</p>
<p>It will perhaps be advisable, in order to avoid repetition, to describe a few of the
special and distinctive sub-rites which form part of many of the more important ceremonies,
such as (in particular), rites performed at shrines, the rite of burning incense,
the scattering <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>of (or banqueting upon) sacrificial rice, and the application of the “Neutralising”
Rice-paste (<i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>).
</p>
<p>Of the rites performed at shrines, Mr. Blagden says: “The worship there, as with most
other <i lang="ms">kramats</i>, consists of the burning of incense, the offering of <i lang="ms">nasi kunyet</i> (yellow rice), and the killing of goats; but I also noticed a number of live pigeons
there which illustrate the practice, common in Buddhist countries, of releasing an
animal in order to gain ‘merit’ thereby.” At a shrine on the Langat river I have seen
fowls which had (I was told) been similarly released.
</p>
<p>Mr. Blagden’s remarks apply with equal force to the services performed at the shrines
of Selangor, and I believe also of other States. It should, however, I think, be pointed
out that the <i lang="ms">nasi kunyit</i> (yellow rice) is, usually at all events, eaten by those who take part in the service.
At a ceremony which was held on one occasion after my recovery from sickness, and
in which, by request, I took part,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4277src" href="#xd32e4277">16</a> incense was burnt, and Muhammadan prayers chanted, after which the usual strip of
white cloth (five cubits in length) was laid upon the saint’s grave (the saint being
the father of the present Sultan of Selangor), and the party then adjourned to a shelter
some twenty or thirty yards lower down the hill, where, first the men, and then the
women and children, partook of the flesh of the slaughtered goat and the saffron-stained
rice (<i lang="ms">pulut</i>). After the meal the Bilal (mosque attendant, who was present with the Malay headman
and the local priest of the mosque), returned to the tomb, and making obeisance, recited
a Muhammadan prayer, craving permission <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>to take the cloth back for his own use, which he presently did. These Bilals are needy
men and live upon the alms of the devout, so I suppose he thought there was no reason
why the saint should not contribute something to his support.
</p>
<p>The burning of incense is one of the very simplest, and hence commonest, forms of
burnt sacrifice. Some magicians say that it should be accompanied by an invocation
addressed to the Spirit of Incense, which should be besought, as in the example quoted
below, to “pervade the seven tiers of earth and sky respectively.” It would appear
that the intention of the worshipper is to ensure that his “sacrifice of sweet savour”
should reach the nostrils of the gods and help to propitiate them, wherever they may
be, by means of a foretaste of offerings to follow. This invocation, however, is not
unfrequently omitted, or at least slurred over by the worshipper, in spite of the
contention of the magicians who use it, that “without it the spell merely rises like
smoke which is blown away by the wind.” The following is one form of the invocation
in question:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Zabur<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4291src" href="#xd32e4291">17</a> Hijau is your name, O Incense,

</div>
<p class="first">The direction taken by the fumes of the incense is observed and noted for the purpose
of divination; this feature of the rite will be noticed under the heading of Medicine.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4322src" href="#xd32e4322">19</a>
</p>
<p>Another form of sacrifice consists in the scattering of rice. The sacrificial rice
(<i lang="la">Oryza sativa</i>) used in the ceremonies is always of the following kinds: firstly, parched rice (<i lang="ms">b’ras bĕrtih</i>); secondly, washed rice (<i lang="ms">b’ras basoh</i>); thirdly, saffron-stained rice (<i lang="ms">b’ras kunyit</i>, <i>i.e.</i> rice stained with turmeric);<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4345src" href="#xd32e4345">20</a> and, finally, a special kind of glutinous rice called <i lang="ms">pulut</i> (<i lang="la">Oryza glutinosa</i>), which is also very generally used for sacrificial banquets.
</p>
<p>Of these, the parched rice is generally used for strewing the bottom of the sacrificial
tray (<i lang="ms">anchak</i>) when the framework has been covered with banana leaves, but the offerings have not
yet been deposited within it.
</p>
<p>The washed and saffron rice are generally used for scattering either over the persons
to be benefited by the ceremony, or else upon the ground or house-floor.
</p>
<p>With reference to the selection of rice for this purpose, it has been suggested that
the rice is intended to attract what may be called the “bird-soul” (<i>i.e.</i> the soul of man conceived as a bird) to the spot, or to <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>keep it from straying at a particularly dangerous moment in the life of its owner.
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">pulut</i> or glutinous rice is the kind of rice generally used for sacrificial banquets, <i>e.g.</i> for banquets at “high places,” etc.
</p>
<p>Lustration is generally accomplished either by means of fire or of water. The best
examples of the former are perhaps the fumigation of infants, and the <i lang="ms">api saleian</i> or purificatory fire, over which women are half-roasted when a birth has taken place,
but these being special and distinctive ceremonies, will be described with others
of the same nature in Chapter VI.
</p>
<p>One of the forms of lustration by water, however, appears rather to take the place
of a sub-rite, forming an integral portion of a large class of ceremonies, such as
those relating to Building, Fishing, Agriculture, Marriage, and so forth. Hence it
will be necessary to give a general sketch of its leading features in the present
context.
</p>
<p>The ceremony of lustration by water, when it takes the form of the sub-rite referred
to, is called “Tĕpong Tawar,” which properly means “the Neutralising Rice-flour (Water),”
“neutralising” being used almost in a chemical sense, <i>i.e.</i> in the sense of “sterilising” the active element of poisons, or of destroying the
active potentialities of evil spirits.
</p>
<p>The rite itself consists in the application<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4391src" href="#xd32e4391">21</a> of a thin paste made by mixing rice-flour with water: this is taken up in a brush
or “bouquet” of leaves and applied to the objects which the “neutralisation” is intended
to protect or neutralise, whether they be the <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>posts of a house, the projecting ends of a boat’s ribs (<i lang="ms">tajok p’rahu</i>), the seaward posts of fishing-stakes (<i lang="ms">puchi kelong</i>), or the forehead and back of the hands of the bride and bridegroom.
</p>
<p>The brush must be first fumigated with incense, then dipped into the bowl which contains
the rice-water, and shaken out almost dry, for if the water runs down the object to
which it is applied it is held to “portend tears,” whereas if it spreads equally all
round (<i lang="ms">benchar</i>) it is lucky. The composition of the brush, which is considered to be of the highest
importance, appears to vary, but only within certain limits. It almost invariably,
in Selangor, consists of a selection of leaves from the following plants, which are
made up in small bouquets of five, seven, or nine leaves each, and bound round with
<i lang="ms">ribu-ribu</i> (a kind of small creeper), or a string of shredded tree bark (<i lang="ms">daun t’rap</i>).
</p>
<p>The following is a list of the leaves generally used:—
</p>
<p>1. Leaves of the grass called <i lang="ms">sambau dara</i>, which is said to be the symbol of a “settled soul” (<i lang="ms">ʿalamat mĕnĕtapkan sĕmangat</i>), and which hence always forms the core of the bouquet.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4423src" href="#xd32e4423">22</a>
</p>
<p>2. The leaves of the <i lang="ms">sĕlaguri</i>, which appears to be “a shrub or small tree with yellow flowers (<i lang="la">Clerodendron disparifolium</i>, Bl., Verbenaceæ; or <i lang="la">Sida rhombifolia</i>, L., Malvaceæ, a common small shrub in open country),”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4439src" href="#xd32e4439">23</a> which is described as one of the first of shrubs (<i lang="ms">kayu asal</i>), and is said to be used as a “reminder of origin” (<i lang="ms">pĕringatan asal</i>).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. The leaves of the <i lang="ms">pulut-pulut</i> (the exact identity of which I have not yet ascertained, but which may be the <i lang="la">Urena lobata</i>, L., one of the Malvaceae), which is said to be used for the same purpose as the
preceding.
</p>
<p>4. The leaves of the <i lang="ms">gandarusa</i> (<span lang="la"><i>Insticia gandarusa</i>, L., Acanthaceæ</span>), a plant described as “often cultivated and half-wild—a shrub used in medicine.”
</p>
<p>The selection of this plant is said to be due to its reputation for scaring demons
(<i lang="ms">ʿalamat mĕnghalaukan hantu</i>). So great is its efficacy supposed to be, that people who have to go out when rain
is falling and the sun shining simultaneously—a most dangerous time to be abroad,
in Malay estimation,—put a sprig of the <i lang="ms">gandarusa</i> in their belts.
</p>
<p>5. The leaves of the <i lang="ms">gandasuli</i> (which I have not yet been able to identify, no such name appearing in Ridley’s plant-list,
but which I believe to be a water-side plant which I have seen, with a white and powerfully
fragrant flower).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4483src" href="#xd32e4483">24</a> It is considered to be a powerful charm against noxious birth-spirits, such as the
<i lang="ms">Langsuir</i>.
</p>
<p>6. The leaves of the <i lang="ms">sapanggil</i> (which is not yet identified).
</p>
<p>7. The leaves of the <i lang="ms">lĕnjuang merah</i>, or “the common red dracæna” (<i lang="la">Cordyline terminalis</i>, var. <i lang="la">ferrea</i>, Liliaceæ).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4508src" href="#xd32e4508">25</a> This shrub is planted in graveyards, and occasionally at the four corners of the
house, to drive away ghosts and demons.
</p>
<p>8. The leaves of the <i lang="ms">sapĕnoh</i> (unidentified), a plant with big round leaves, which is always placed outside the
rest of the leaves in the bunch.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>9. To the above list may be perhaps added the <i lang="ms">satawar</i>, <i lang="ms">sitawar</i> or <i lang="ms">tawar-tawar</i> (<i lang="la">Costus speciosus</i>, L., Scitamineæ, and <i lang="la">Forrestia, spp.</i> Commelinaceæ); and
</p>
<p>10. The <i lang="ms">satĕbal</i> (<i lang="la">Fagræa racemosa</i>, Jack., Loganiaceæ).
</p>
<p>Leaves of the foregoing plants and shrubs are made up, as has been said, in small
sets or combinations of five, seven, or even perhaps of nine leaves a piece. These
combinations are said to differ according to the object to which the rice-water is
to be applied. It is extremely unlikely, however, that all magicians should make the
same selections even for the same objects—rather would they be likely to make use
of such leaves on the list as happen to be most readily available. Still, however,
as the only example of such differentiation which I have yet been able to obtain,
I will give the details of three separate and distinctive combinations, which were
described to me by a Selangor magician:—

<p>Further inquiry and the collection of additional material will no doubt help to elucidate
the general principles on which such selections are made.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>Short rhyming charms are very often used as accompaniments of the rite of rice-water,
but appear to be seldom if ever repeated aloud. The following is a specimen, and others
will be found in the Appendix:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4651src" href="#xd32e4651">26</a>—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Neutralising Rice-paste, true Rice-paste,
</p>
<p class="line">And, thirdly, Rice-paste of Kadangsa!
</p>
<p class="line">Keep me from sickness, keep me from death,
</p>
<p class="line">Keep me from injury and ruin.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Other not less important developments of the idea of lustration by water are to be
found in such ceremonies as the bathing of mother and child after a birth and the
washing of the floor (<i lang="ms">basoh lantei</i>) upon similar occasions, the bathing of the sick, of bride and bridegroom at weddings,
of corpses (<i lang="ms">mĕruang</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4671src" href="#xd32e4671">27</a> and the annual bathing expeditions (<i lang="ms">mandi Safar</i>), which are supposed to purify the persons of the bathers and to protect them from
evil (<i lang="ms">tolak bala</i>).
</p>
<p>Fasting, or the performance of religious penance, which is now but seldom practised,
would appear to have been only undertaken in former days with a definite object in
view, such as the production of the state of mental exaltation which induces ecstatic
visions, the acquisition of supernatural powers (<i lang="ms">sakti</i>), and so forth.
</p>
<p>The fast always took place, of course, in a solitary spot, and not unfrequently upon
the top of some high and solitary hill such as Mount Ophir (Gunong Ledang), on the
borders of Malacca territory. Frequently, however, much lower hills, or even plains
which possessed some remarkable rock or tree, would be selected for the purpose.
</p>
<p>Such fasting, however, did not, as sometimes with <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>us, convey to the Malays the idea of complete abstinence, as the magicians informed
me that a small modicum of rice contained in a <i lang="ms">kĕtupat</i> (which is a small diamond-shaped rice-receptacle made of plaited cocoa-nut leaf)
was the daily “allowance” of any one who was fasting. The result was that fasts might
be almost indefinitely prolonged, and the thrice-seven-days’ fast of ’Che Utus upon
Jugra Hill, on the Selangor coast,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4694src" href="#xd32e4694">28</a> is still one of the traditions of that neighbourhood, whilst in Malay romances and
in Malay tradition this form of religious penance is frequently represented as continuing
for years.
</p>
<p>Finally, I would draw attention to the strong vein of Sympathetic Magic or “make believe”
which runs through and leavens the whole system of Malay superstition. The root-idea
of this form of magic has been said to be the principle that “cause follows from effect.”
</p>
<p>“One of the principles of sympathetic magic is that any effect may be produced by
imitating it.… If it is wished to kill a person, an image of him is made and then
destroyed; and it is believed that through a certain physical sympathy between the
person and his image, the man feels the injuries done to the image as if they were
done to his own body, and that when it is destroyed he must simultaneously perish.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4701src" href="#xd32e4701">29</a>
</p>
<p>The principle thus described is perhaps the most important of all those which underlie
the “Black Art” of the Malays.

is difficult to convey the real idea, as Malays call a man <i lang="ms">kramat</i> who is able to get whatever he wishes for, who is able to foretell events, and whose

yet they are called <i lang="ms">kramats</i>.” [There is, however, a tradition that a saint’s <i>leg</i> was buried at Batu Hampar!—W. S.]&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e3942src" title="Return to note 6 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="first">A careful investigation of the magic rites and charms used by a nation which has changed
its religion will not unfrequently show, that what is generally called witchcraft
is merely the <i lang="fr">débris</i> of the older ritual, condemned by the priests of the newer faith, but yet stubbornly,
though secretly, persisting, through the unconquerable religious conservatism of the
mass of the people.
</p>
<p>“There is nothing that clings longer to a race than the religious faith in which it
has been nurtured. Indeed, it is impossible for any mind that is not thoroughly scientific
to cast off entirely the religious forms of thought in which it has grown to maturity.
Hence in every people that has received the impression of foreign beliefs, we find
that the latter do not expel and supersede the older religion, but are engrafted on
it, blent with it, or overlie it. Observances are more easily abandoned than ideas,
and even when all the external forms of the alien faith have been put on, and few
vestiges of the indigenous one remain, the latter still retains its vitality in the
mind, and powerfully colours or corrupts the former. The actual religion of <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>a people is thus of great ethnographic interest, and demands a minute and searching
observation. No other facts relating to rude tribes are more difficult of ascertainment,
or more often elude inquiry.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4732src" href="#xd32e4732">1</a>
</p>
<p>“The general principle stated by Logan in the passage just quoted receives remarkable
illustration from a close investigation of the folk-lore and superstitious beliefs
of the Malays. Two successive religious changes have taken place among them, and when
we have succeeded in identifying the vestiges of Brahmanism which underlie the external
forms of the faith of Muhammad, long established in all Malay kingdoms, we are only
half-way through our task.<span class="corr" id="xd32e4738" title="Not in source">”</span>
</p>
<p>“There yet remain the powerful influences of the still earlier indigenous faith to
be noted and accounted for. Just as the Buddhists of Ceylon turn in times of sickness
and danger, not to the consolations offered by the creed of Buddha, but to the propitiation
of the demons feared and reverenced by their early progenitors, and just as the Burmese
and Talaings, though Buddhists, retain in full force the whole of the <i>Nat</i> superstition, so among the Malays, in spite of centuries which have passed since
the establishment of an alien worship, the Muhammadan peasant may be found invoking
the protection of Hindu gods against the spirits of evil with which his primitive
faith has peopled all natural objects.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4744src" href="#xd32e4744">2</a>
</p>
<p>“What was the faith of Malaya seven hundred years ago it is hard to say, but there
is a certain amount of evidence to lead to the belief that it was a form of Brahmanism,
and that, no doubt, had succeeded the original spirit worship.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4752src" href="#xd32e4752">3</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>The evidence of folk-lore, taken in conjunction with that supplied by charm-books
and romances, goes to show that the greater gods of the Malay Pantheon, though modified
in some respects by Malay ideas, were really borrowed Hindu divinities, and that only
the lesser gods and spirits are native to the Malay religious system. It is true that
some of these native gods can be with more or less distinctness identified with the
great powers of nature: the King of the Winds (Raja Angin) for instance; “Mambang
Tali Harus,” or the god of mid-currents (the Malay Neptune); the gods of thunder and
lightning, of the celestial bodies, etc.; but none of them appear to have the status
of the chief gods of the Hindu system, and both by land and water the terrible Shiva
(“Batara Guru” or “Kala”) is supreme. Yet each department of nature, however small,
has its own particular godling or spirit who requires propitiation, and influences
for good or evil every human action. Only the moral element is wanting to the divine
hegemony—the “cockeyed,” limping substitute which does duty for it reflecting only
too truthfully the character of the people with whom it passes as divine.
</p>
<p>I will first take, in detail, the gods of Hindu origin. “Batara (or Bĕtara) Guru”
is “the name by which Siva is known to his worshippers, who constitute the vast majority
of the Balinese, and who probably constituted the bulk of the old Javanese.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4761src" href="#xd32e4761">4</a>
</p>
<p>In the magic of the Peninsular Malays we find Vishnu the Preserver, Brahma the Creator,
Batara Guru, Kala, and S’ri simultaneously appealed to by the Malay magician; and
though it would, perhaps, be rash, <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>(as Mr. Wilkinson says), to infer <i>solely</i> from Malay romances or Malay theatrical invocations (many of which owe much to Javanese
influence), that Hinduism was the more ancient religion of the Malays, there is plenty
of other evidence to prove that the “Batara Guru” of the Malays (no less than the
Batara Guru of Bali and Java) is none other than the recognised father of the Hindu
Trinity.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4774src" href="#xd32e4774">5</a>
</p>
<p>Of the greater deities or gods, Batara Guru is unquestionably the greatest. “In the
Hikayat Sang Samba (the Malay version of the Bhaumakavya), Batara Guru appears as
a supreme God, with Brahma and Vishnu as subordinate deities. It is Batara Guru who
alone has the water of life (<i lang="ms">ayer utama (atama) jiwa</i>) which brings the slaughtered heroes to life.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4808src" href="#xd32e4808">6</a>
</p>
<p>So to this day the Malay magician declares that ’Toh Batara Guru (under any one of
the many corruptions which his name now bears<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4816src" href="#xd32e4816">7</a>) was “the all-powerful <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>spirit who held the place of Allah before the advent of Muhammadanism, a spirit so
powerful that he could restore the dead to life; and to him all prayers were addressed.”
</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkinson, in the article from which we have already quoted, deals with another
point of interest, the expression <i lang="ms">sang-yang</i>, or <i lang="ms">batara</i>, which is prefixed to <i lang="ms">guru</i>. After pointing out that <i lang="ms">yang</i> in this case is not the ordinary Malay pronoun (<i lang="ms">yang</i>, who), but an old word meaning a “deity,” he remarks, that so far as he has been
able to discover, it is only used of the <i>greater</i> Hindu divinities, and not of inferior deities or demi-gods. Thus we find it applied
to Shiva and Vishnu, but never to the monkey-god Hanuman, or a deity of secondary
importance like Dermadewa. Such inferior divinities have only <i>the lesser honorific</i> “sang” prefixed to their names, and in this respect fare no better than mere mortals
(such as Sang Sapurba and Sang Ranjuna Tapa) and animals (such as, in fables, Sang
Kanchil, Mr. Mousedeer; and Sang Tikus, Mr. Rat).
</p>
<p>“The expression <i lang="ms">batara</i> is also limited to the greater Hindu divinities (except when used as a royal title),
<i>e.g.</i> Batara Guru, Batara Kala, Batara Indra, Batara Bisnu, etc. Thus the expressions <i lang="ms">sang-yang</i> and <i lang="ms">batara</i> are fairly coincident in their application.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4910src" href="#xd32e4910">8</a> But there are a few deities of whom <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>the honorific <i lang="ms">sang-yang</i> is used, but not <i lang="ms">batara</i>, e.g. <i lang="ms">sang-yang tunggal</i>, ‘the only God,’ <i lang="ms">sang-yang sokma</i>, etc.
</p>
<p>“Thus <i lang="ms">batara</i> would seem to be limited in use to the actual names of Hindu deities as distinct
from epithets describing those deities. “Batara Guru” would seem to be an exception—the
only one—to this rule, and to point to the fact that the original meaning of <i lang="ms">guru</i> had been lost sight of, and that the <i>expression</i> had come to be regarded only as a proper name.”
</p>
<p>Occasionally, as is only to be expected, the Malays get mixed in their mythology,
and of this Mr. Wilkinson gives two examples, one of the identification of Batara
Guru (Shiva) with Brahma (Bĕrahmana), and another of the drawing of a distinction
between “Guru” (Shiva) and “Mahadewa,” which latter is only another name for the same
divinity.
</p>
<p>Such slips are inevitable among an illiterate people, and should always be criticised
by comparison with the original Hindu tenets, from which these ideas may be presumed
to have proceeded.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Wilkinson quotes an extraordinary genealogy representing, <i>inter alia</i>, “Guru as the actual father of the Hindu Trinity,” and also of “Sambu” (whom he cannot
identify), and “Sĕri, who is the Hindu Sri, the goddess of grain, and, therefore,
a deity of immense importance to the old Javanese and Malays.”
</p>
<p>On this I would only remark that Sambu (or Jambu) is the first portion of the name
almost universally ascribed to the Crocodile-spirit by the Peninsular Malays.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5018src" href="#xd32e5018">9</a>
</p>
<p>It would be beyond the scope of this work to attempt the identification of Batara
Guru (Shiva) with all the numerous manifestations and titles attributed to him by
the Malays, but the special manifestation (of Shiva), which is called “Kala,” forms
an integral part of the general conception, whether among the <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>Malays or Hindus, and is, therefore, deserving of some attention.
</p>
<p>The Malay conception of Batara Guru seems to have been that he had both a good and
a bad side to his character. Though he was “Destroyer” he was also “Restorer-to-life,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5059src" href="#xd32e5059">10</a> and it would appear that these two opposite manifestations of his power tended to
develop into two distinct personalities, a development which apparently was never
entirely consummated. This, however, is not the only difficulty, for on investigating
the limits of the respective spheres of influence of Batara Guru and Kala, we find
that the only sphere, which is always admitted to be under Kala’s influence, is the
<i>intermediate</i> zone between the respective spheres of influence of Batara Guru (as he is called
if on land, “Si Raya” if at sea) and a <i>third</i> divinity, who goes by the name of “<span lang="ms">’Toh Panjang Kuku</span>,” or “Grandsire Long-Claws.”
</p>
<p>Now Hindu mythology, we are told, knows next to nothing of the sea, and any such attempt
as this to define the respective boundaries of sea and land is almost certain to be
due to the influence of Malay ideas. Again, the intermediate zone is not necessarily
considered less dangerous than that of definitely evil influences. Thus the most dangerous
time for children to be abroad is sunset, the hour when we can “call it neither perfect
day nor night”; so too a day of mingled rain and sunshine is regarded as fraught with
peculiar dangers from evil spirits, and it would be quite in keeping with such ideas
that the intermediate zone, whether between high and low water-mark, or between the
clearing and primeval <span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>forest, should be assigned to Kala, the Destroyer. In which case the expression “Grandsire
Long-Claws” might be used to signify this special manifestation of Shiva on land,
possibly through the personality of the Tiger, just as the Crocodile-spirit appears
to represent Shiva by water.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5074src" href="#xd32e5074">11</a>
</p>
<p>We thus reach a point of exceptional interest, for hunting, being among the old Hindus
one of the seven deadly sins, was regarded as a low pursuit, and one which would never
be indulged in by a god. Yet I was repeatedly told when collecting charms about the
Spectre Huntsman that he was a god, and, explicitly, that he was Batara Guru. This
shows the strength of the Malay influences which had been at work, and which had actually
succeeded in corrupting the character, so to speak, of the supreme god of this borrowed
Hindu Trinity.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5079src" href="#xd32e5079">12</a>
</p>
<p>The Batara Guru of the Sea, who by some magicians, at all events, is identified with
Si Raya (the “Great One”), and, probably wrongly, with the God of Mid-currents<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5094src" href="#xd32e5094">13</a> (Mambang Tali Harus), is of a much milder character than his terrestrial namesake
or compeer, and although sickness may sometimes be <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>ascribed to the sea-spirit’s wrath, it is neither so sudden nor so fatal as the sickness
ascribed to the wanton and unprovoked malice of the Spectre Huntsman, or Spirit of
the Land.
</p>
<p>Fishermen and seafarers, on the other hand, obtain many a favour from him, and even
hope to make friends with him by means of simple sacrifices and charms.
</p>
<p>Si Raya (or Madu-Raya) is said to have a family, his wife’s name being Madu-ruti,
and his children “Wa’ Ranai,” and “Si Kĕkas” (the scratcher), all of whom, however,
have their own separate spheres of influence. The “Great One” himself (Madu-Raya)
rules over the sea from low-water mark (at the river’s mouth) out to mid-ocean; and
if his identity with “<span lang="ms">’Toh Rimpun ʿAlam</span>” is accepted,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5105src" href="#xd32e5105">14</a> his place of abode is at the navel of the seas, within the central whirlpool (Pusat
Tasek), from the centre of which springs the Magic Tree (Pauh Janggi), on whose boughs
perches the roc (<i lang="ms">garuda</i>) of fable, and at whose foot dwells the Gigantic Crab, whose entrance into and exit
from the cave in which he dwells is supposed to cause the displacement of water which
results in the ebb and flow of the tide.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5115src" href="#xd32e5115">15</a>
</p>
<p>The only other divinities (of the rank of “Mambangs”) which are of any importance
are the “White divinity,” who dwells in the Sun, the “Black divinity,” who dwells
in the Moon, and the “Yellow divinity,” who dwells in the Yellow Sunset-glow, which
latter is always considered most dangerous to children.
</p>
<p>When there is a decided glow at sunset, any one who sees it takes water into his mouth
(<i lang="ms">di-kĕmam ayer</i>) <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>and dislodges it in the direction of the brightness, at the same time throwing ashes
(<i lang="ms">di-sĕmbor dĕngan abu</i>) saying:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i lang="ms">Mambang kuning, mambang k’labu,</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i lang="ms">Pantat kuning di-sĕmbor abu.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="first">This is done “in order to put out the brightness,” the reason that it must be put
out being that in the case of any one who is not very strong (<i lang="ms">lĕmah sĕmangat</i>) it causes fever.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The “Jins” or “Genii,” generally speaking, form a very extensive class of quite subordinate
divinities, godlings, or spirits, whose place in Malay mythology is clearly due, whether
directly or indirectly, to Muhammadan influences, but who may be most conveniently
treated here as affording a sort of connecting link between gods and ghosts. There
has, it would appear, been a strong tendency on the part of the Malays to identify
these imported spirits with the spirits of their older (Hindu) religion, but the only
Genie who really rises to the level of one of the great Hindu divinities is the Black
King of the Genii (Sang Gala<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5153src" href="#xd32e5153">16</a> Raja, or Sa-Raja Jin), who appears at times a manifestation of Shiva Batara Guru,
who is confounded with the destructive side of Shiva, <i>i.e.</i> Kala. This at least would appear to be the only theory on which we could explain
the use of many of the epithets or attributes assigned to the King of the Genii, who
is at one time called “the one and only God”; at another, “Bĕntara (<i>i.e.</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>Batara), Guru, the Genie that was from the beginning,” and at another, “the Land Demon,
the <i>Black</i> Batara Guru,” etc.
</p>
<p>The following is a description of this, the mightiest of the Genii:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Peace be with you!
</p>
<p class="line">Ho, Black Genie with the Black Liver,
</p>
<p class="line">Black Heart and Black Lungs,
</p>
<p class="line">Black Spleen and tusk-like Teeth,
</p>
<p class="line">Scarlet Breast and body-hairs inverted,
</p>
<p class="line">And with only a single bone.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5173src" href="#xd32e5173">17</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">So far as can be made out from the meagre evidence obtainable, the spirit thus described
is identifiable with the Black King of Genii, who dwells in the Heart of the Earth,
and whose bride, Sang Gadin (or Gading), presented him with seven strapping Black
Genii as children.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5181src" href="#xd32e5181">18</a>

<p></p>
<div class="figure plate02-1width" id="plate02-1"><img src="images/plate02-1.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="585"></div><p>

<p class="first">Models of the White and Black Genii (<i lang="ms">Jin Puteh</i> and <i lang="ms">Jin Hitam</i>)
</p>
<p><i>Page 94.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Altogether there are one hundred and ninety of these (Black?) Genii—more strictly,
perhaps, one hundred and ninety-three, which coincides curiously with the number of
“Mischiefs” (Badi), which reside in “all living things.” The resemblance, I may add,
does not end here; for though the Genii <i>may</i> do good, and the “Badi” do not, both are considered able to do infinite harm to mortals,
and both make choice of the same kind of dwelling-places, such as hollows in the hills,
solitary patches of primeval forest, dead parasites on trees, etc. etc.
</p>
<p>As to the origin of these Genii, one magician told me that all “Jins” came from the
country “Ban <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>Ujan,” which may possibly be Persia<span id="xd32e5239"></span>;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5241src" href="#xd32e5241">19</a> other magicians, however, variously derive them from the dissolution of various parts
of the anatomy of the great snake “Sakatimuna,” of the “First Great Failure” to make
man’s image (at the creation of man); from the drops of blood which spirted up to
heaven when the first twins, Abel and Cain (in the Malay version Habil and Kabil)
bit their thumbs; from the big cocoa-nut monkey or baboon (<i lang="ms">bĕrok bĕsar</i>), and so on.
</p>
<p>The theory already mentioned, viz. that the Black King of the Genii gradually came
to be identified with Kala, and later came gradually to be established as a separate
personality, appears to be the only one which will satisfactorily explain the relations
subsisting between the Black and White Genii, who are on the one hand distinctly declared
to be brothers, whilst the White Genie is in another passage declared to be Maharaja
Dewa or Mahadewa, which latter is, as we have already seen, a special name of Shiva.
</p>
<p>This White Genie is said to have sprung, by one account, from the blood-drops which
fell on the ground when Habil and Kabil bit their thumbs; by another, from the irises
of the snake Sakatimuna’s eyes (<i lang="ms">bĕnih mata Sakatimuna</i>), and is sometimes confused with the White Divinity (’Toh Mambang Puteh), who lives
in the sun.
</p>
<p>The name of his wife is not mentioned, as it is in the case of the Black Genie, but
the names of three of his children have been preserved, and they are Tanjak <span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>Malim Kaya, Pari Lang (lit. kite-like, <i>i.e.</i> “winged” Skate), and Bintang Sutan (or Star of Sutan).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5272src" href="#xd32e5272">20</a>
</p>
<p>On the whole, I may say that the White Genie is very seldom mentioned in comparison
with the Black Genie, and that whereas absolutely no harm, so far as I can find out,
is recorded of him, he is, on the other hand, appealed to for protection by his worshippers.
</p>
<p>A very curious subdivision of Genii into Faithful (Jin Islām) and Infidel (Jin Kafir)
is occasionally met with, and it is said, moreover, that Genii (it is to be hoped
orthodox ones) may be sometimes <i>bought</i> at Mecca from the “Sheikh Jin” (Headman of Genii) at prices varying from $90 to $100
a piece.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5280src" href="#xd32e5280">21</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>Besides these subdivisions, certain Genii are sometimes specifically connected with
special objects or ideas. Thus there are the Genii of the royal musical instruments
(Jin Nĕmfiri, or Lĕmpiri, Gĕndang, and Naubat), who are sometimes identified with
the Genii of the State (Jin Karaja’an), and the Genii of the Royal Weapons (Jin Sĕmbuana),
both of which classes of Genii are held able to strike men dead. The only other Genie
that I would here specially mention is the Jin ʿAfrit (sometimes called Jin Rafrit),
from whom the “White Man” (a designation which is often specially used in the Peninsula
as a synonym for Englishman) is sometimes said to have sprung, but who belongs in
Arabian mythology to a higher class than the mere Genii. Before leaving the subject
of Genii, I must, however, point out the extremely common juxtaposition of the Arabic
word “Jin” and the Malay “Jĕmbalang.” From the frequency with which this juxtaposition
occurs, and from the fact that the two appear to be used largely as convertible terms,
we might expect to find that Jin and Jĕmbalang were mere synonyms, both applicable
to similar classes of spirits. The process is not quite complete, however, as although
the expression Jĕmbalang Tunggal (the only Jĕmbalang), is found as well as Jin Tunggal,
the higher <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>honorific Sang Raja or Sa-Raja is never, so far as I am aware, prefixed to the word
“Jĕmbalang,” though it is frequently prefixed to “Jin.” Of the other members of the
Malay hierarchy who owe their introduction to Muhammadan influences, the only ones
of importance are angels (Mala’ikat), prophets (Nabi), and headmen (Sheikh).
</p>
<p>I will take them in this order.
</p>
<p>Of the angels, unquestionably the most important are Azrael (ʿAzra’il or ʿIjrail),
Michael (Mika’il), Israfel (Israfil, Ijrafil, or Serafil), and Gabriel (Jibra’il or
’Jabra’il, often corrupted into Raja Brahil). There can be no doubt that the foregoing
are meant for the names of a group of four archangels, the name of Israfel corresponding
to Abdiel, who generally occupies the fourth place in our own angelic hierarchy.
</p>
<p>Their customary duties are apportioned among the four great angels as follows:—
</p>
<p>Azrael is, as with us, the angel of death, who “carries off the lives of all creatures”;
Israfel is “lord of all the different airs” in our body; Michael is the “giver of
daily bread”; and Gabriel is a messenger or “bringer of news.”
</p>
<p>Sometimes, again, a White Angel (Mala’ikat Puteh) is mentioned, <i>e.g.</i> as being in “charge of all things in the jungle,” but what his specific duties are
in this connection does not transpire.
</p>
<p>In an invocation addressed to the Sea-spirit, however, we find four more such angels
mentioned, all of whom hold similar charges:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Chitar Ali is the angel’s name, who is lord of the whirlpool;
</p>
<p class="line">Sabur Ali is the angel’s name, who is lord of the winds;
</p>
<p class="line">Sir Ali is the angel’s name, who is lord of the waters of the sea;
</p>
<p class="line">Putar Ali is the angel’s name, who is lord of the rainbow.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p class="first">No doubt the names of many more of the subordinate angels might be collected, as we
are repeatedly told that they are forty-four in number.
</p>
<p>Of the prophets (Nabi) there are an indefinite number, the title being applied to
many of the more prominent characters who figure in our own Old Testament (as well
as in the Korān), but who would not by ourselves be considered to possess any special
qualifications for prophetic office. Among the more famous of these I may mention
(after Muhammad and his immediate compeers) the prophet Solomon (sometimes considered—no
doubt owing to his unrivalled reputation for magical skill—as the king of the Genii,
whose assistance the hunter or trapper is continually invoking); the prophet David,
celebrated for the beauty of his voice; and the prophet Joseph, celebrated for the
beauty of his countenance. Besides these (and others of the same type), there is a
group of minor prophets whose assistance is continually invoked in charms; these are
the prophet Tap (Tĕtap or Kĕtap?), “lord of the earth;” the prophet Khailir (Khaithir
or Khizr), “lord of water;” the prophet Noah, “lord of trees;” and the prophet Elias,
“planter of trees.”
</p>
<p>Khizr is often confounded with Elias. He discovered and drank of the fountain of life
(whence his connection with water), and will consequently not die till the last trump.
</p>
<p>Next to the prophets comes the “Sultan” (Sultan), or “King” (Malik), both of which
Arabic titles, however, are somewhat rarely used by Malay magicians. Still we find
such expressions as Sa-Raja (Sang-Raja?) Malik (King of Kings) applied to Batara Guru.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>Next to these royal honorifics comes the title of “Headman” or “Sheikh.”
</p>
<p>There are, it is usually stated, four of these Sheikhs who are “penned” (<i lang="ms">di-kandang</i>) in the Four Corners of the Earth respectively, and whose names are ʿAbdul Kadir,
ʿAbdul Muri, a third whose name is not mentioned, and ʿAbdul ʿAli.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5345src" href="#xd32e5345">22</a>
</p>
<p>Sometimes they are called “Sheikh ʿAlam” (or Si Putar ʿAlam), and are each said to
reside “within a ring-fence of white iron.” Hence we obtain a perfectly intelligible
meaning for the expression, “<i>Ask pardon of the Four Corners of the World</i>,” <i>i.e.</i> of the Sheikhs who reside therein, though the phrase sounds ridiculous enough without
such explanation.
</p>
<p>The only other Arabic title which is perhaps worth noticing here<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5356src" href="#xd32e5356">23</a> is that of “Priest” (Imām), which we find somewhat curiously used in an invocation
addressed to the sea-spirit. “Imām An Jalil is the name of the ‘<i>Priest of the Sea</i>.’ ”
</p>
<p>In the invocation addressed to the Sea-spirit we find the expression:—
</p>
<p>“Jungle-chief of the World is the name of the Old Man of the Sea.”
</p>
<p>There can, however, be little doubt that this “Old Man of the Sea” is a mere synonym
for Batara Guru.
</p>
<p>A set of expressions to which special reference should perhaps be made consists of
the titles used by the wild jungle tribes (Sakais), the use of which <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>is important as confirming the principle that the “Autochthones” are more influential
with the spirits residing in their land than any later arrivals can be, whatever skill
the latter may have acquired in the magic arts of the country from whence they came.
</p>
<p>“Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, Munshi, in his Autobiography, has an interesting passage
on the beliefs of the Malays on the subject of spirits and demons, beliefs which are
much more deeply-rooted than is generally supposed. He does not, however, differentiate
between national customs and beliefs, and those which have come in with the Muhammadan
religion. And indeed it is not easy to do so. Here, everything is classed under the
generic term <i lang="ms">sheitan</i>, which is Arabic, and we find the <i lang="ms">rakshasa</i> of Hindu romances and the <i lang="ms">jin</i> and <i lang="ms">ʿefrit</i> of the Arabian Nights in the company of a lot of Indo-Chinese spirits and goblins,
who have not come from the West like the others:—
</p>
<p>“I explained to Mr. M. clearly the names of all the <i lang="ms">sheitan</i> believed in by Chinese and Malays; all ignorance and folly which have come down from

Some of these arts have their professors (<i lang="ms">guru</i>) from whom instruction may be got. Others have their doctors, who can say this is
such and such a disease, and this is the remedy for it, and besides these there are
all those arts which are able to cause evil to man. When Mr. M. heard all this he
was astonished and wondered, and said, ‘Do you know the stories of all these?’ I replied,
‘If I were to explain all about them it would fill a large book, and the contents
of the book would be all ignorance and nonsense without any worth, and sensible persons
would not like to listen to it, they would merely laugh at it.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5812src" href="#xd32e5812">56</a>
</p>
<p>To the foregoing the following list of spirits and ghosts may be added.
</p>
<p>The Hantu Kubor (Grave Demons) are the spirits of the dead, who are believed to prey
upon the living whenever they get an opportunity. With them may be classed the “<i lang="ms">Hantu orang mati di-bunoh</i>,” or “spirits of murdered men.”
</p>
<p>“The Hantu Ribut is the storm-fiend that howls in the blast and revels in the whirlwind.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5831src" href="#xd32e5831">57</a>
</p>
<p>The Hantu Ayer and Hantu Laut are Water and Sea-spirits, and the Hantu Bandan is the
Spirit of the Waterfall, which “may often be seen lying prone on the water, with head
like an inverted copper (<i lang="ms">kawah</i>),” where the water rushes down the fall between the rocks.
</p>
<p>The Hantu Longgak<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5843src" href="#xd32e5843">58</a> is continually looking up in <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>the air. Those who are attacked by him foam at the mouth.
</p>
<p>The Hantu Rimba (Deep-forest Demon), Hantu Raya<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5853src" href="#xd32e5853">59</a> (“Great” Demon), Hantu Dĕnei (Demon of Wild-beast-tracks), the Hantu-hantuan (Echo-spirits),
and I think the Hantu Bakal, are all spirits of the jungle, but are perhaps somewhat
less localised than the large class of spirits (such as the Malacca-cane, <i lang="ms">gharu</i>, gutta, and camphor-tree spirits) which are specially associated with particular
trees.
</p>
<p>The Hantu B’rok is the Baboon Demon (the B’rok being what is generally called the
“cocoa-nut monkey,” a sort of big baboon); it is sometimes supposed to take possession
of dancers, and enable them, whilst unconscious, to perform wonderful climbing feats.
</p>
<p>The Hantu Bĕlian, according to many Selangor Malays, is a tiger-spirit which takes
the form of a bird. This bird is said to be not unlike the raquet-tailed king-crow
(<i lang="ms">chĕnchawi</i>), and to sit on the tiger’s back; whence it plucks out the tiger’s fur and swallows
it, never allowing it to fall to the ground.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5866src" href="#xd32e5866">60</a>
</p>
<p>The Hantu Songkei<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5872src" href="#xd32e5872">61</a> is the spirit who so often interferes with the toils for catching wild animals and
snares for wildfowl (<i lang="ms">yang kachau jaring dan rachik</i>). He is described as being invisible below the breast, <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>with a nose of enormous length, and eye-sockets stretched sideways to such an extent
that he can see all round him.
</p>
<p>The following charm is recited in order to “neutralise” his evil influence:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Peace be with you, grandson of the Spectre Huntsman,

</div>
<p class="first">Giants are called Bota (Bhuta), Raksasa, and Gargasi (<i lang="ms">gasi-gasi</i> or <i lang="ms">gĕgasi</i>), or sometimes Hantu Tinggi (“Tall Demons”), the first two of these names being clearly
derivable from a Sanskrit origin.
</p>
<p>In addition to those enumerated we may add the various classes of “good people,” such
as the Bidadari <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>(or Bĕdiadari) or Pĕri (fairies and elves), which are of foreign origin, and the “Orang
Bunyian,” a class of Malay spirits about whom very little seems known. The latter
appear to be a race of good fairies, who are so simple-minded that they can be very
easily cheated. Thus it is always said of them, that whenever they come into a hamlet,
as they may occasionally do, to buy anything, they always pay without bargaining whatever
price is asked, however exorbitant it may be. I have been told of their existence
at Kapar village (near Klang in Selangor), at Jugra, where it was said they might
formerly be heard paddling their boats upon the river when no boat was visible, and
elsewhere.
</p>
<p>Besides these there are several kinds of bloodsucking (vampire) demons, which are
mostly Birth-spirits; and also certain <i>incubi</i>, such as the Hantu Kopek, which is the Malay equivalent of our own “night-mare.”

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e4816src">7</a></span> Cp. Crawfurd, <i>Hist. of the Ind. Archipelago</i>, vol. ii. p. 219. “From some of the usual epithets bestowed upon Siwa by the pagan
Javanese, and still familiar to their posterity, the pre-eminence of this deity is
clearly demonstrated.… He is the same personage who acts so distinguished a part in
the machinery of Malayan and Javanese romances, under the appellation of <i lang="ms">Guru</i>, or the instructor, prefixing to it the word <i lang="ms">Batara</i>, a corruption of <i lang="ms">Avatara</i>, both in sense and orthography, for with the Indian islanders that word is not used
as with the genuine Hindus, to express the incarnation of a god, but as an appellation
expressing any deity; nay, as if conferring an apotheosis upon their princes, it has
been sometimes prefixed to the names of some of the most celebrated of their ancient
kings. When Siwa appears in this character, in the romances of the Indian islanders,
he is painted as a powerful, mischievous, and malignant tyrant—a description sufficiently
consonant to his character of Destroyer in the Hindu triad”; and, again, “<i lang="ms">ywang</i> is a Javanese word used in the same sense as <i lang="ms">batara</i>.… Usually the obsolete relative pronoun <i lang="ms">sang</i>, which has the sense, in this case, of a definite article, is placed before it. Thus <i lang="ms">sangywang guru</i> is the same as <i lang="ms">batara guru.</i>… It is probably the same word also which forms the last part of a word in extensive
use, <i lang="ms">sâmbahayang</i>, ‘worship or adoration.’ ”—Crawfurd, <i>Mal. Grammar</i>, p. cxcviii. To this I may add that the form <i lang="ms">ywang</i>, when used by the Peninsular Malays, becomes “<i lang="ms">yang</i>,” <i lang="ms">sangyang</i> being also found.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Another (and probably better) etymology of <i lang="ms">batara</i> is given by Favre and Wilken, viz. Sanskr. <i lang="ms">bhattara</i>, “lord.”&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e4816src" title="Return to note 7 in text.">↑</a></p>

<div class="fndiv" id="xd32e4910">
<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e4910src">8</a></span> To these should perhaps be added <i lang="ms">dewa</i>, <i lang="ms">mambang</i> (?), and <i lang="ms">sa-raja</i> (or <i lang="ms">sang raja</i>), if Mr. Wilkinson’s explanation of this last expression be taken as correct. And in any case its use in combination with <i lang="ms">guru</i> appears to warrant its classification with the titles applied to the greater deities.
It is also, however, used, like <i lang="ms">sang</i>, of inferior deities and even of animals (<i>e.g.</i> in a “Spectre Huntsman” charm) we find “<i lang="ms">Lansat, sa-raja anjing</i>, etc.” <i lang="ms">Dewa</i> is used indiscriminately (occasionally in conjunction with <i lang="ms">mambang</i>) both of the greater and lesser divinities. Thus we not unfrequently find such expressions
as <i lang="ms">Dewa Bisnu</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Vishnu), <i lang="ms">dewa mambang</i>, <i lang="ms">dewa dan mambang</i>, etc.; and we are expressly told that they (the Dewas) “are so called because they
are immortal.” <i lang="ms">Mambang</i> (per se) is <i>said</i> to be similarly used, not only of greater (<i>vide</i> App. <a href="#a.xvii">xvii</a>.), but of lesser divinities, and “Mambang Tali Harus,” god of mid-currents, has even
been explained as referring to Batara Guru (Shiva). This, however, is no doubt an
instance of confusion, as it generally appears to be used with the “colour” attributes
(<i>e.g.</i> <i lang="ms">M. puteh</i>, White; <i lang="ms">M. hitam</i>, Black; <i lang="ms">M. kuning</i>, Yellow) usually assigned to the inferior divinities; and, moreover, in an invocation
addressed to the sea-spirit, the “god of mid-currents” is requested to forward a message
to Dato’ Rimpun ʿAlam, which appears to be merely another name for Batara Guru, the
reason given for the preferment of this request being that he is in the habit of “visiting
the Heart of the Seas” in which ’Toh Rimpun ʿAlam dwells (the title of the latter
being perhaps taken from the <i>tree</i>, Pauh Janggi).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e4910src" title="Return to note 8 in text.">↑</a></p>

and its application to the crocodile-spirit would appear to indicate that this latter
was, formerly, at least, regarded as an embodiment of that supreme god’s manifestation
as a water-god. It is worth while to compare this with the expression “<span lang="ms">’Toh Panjang Kuku</span>,” which is applied to the corresponding manifestation of the supreme god on land,
and which strongly suggests the tiger.

<p class="footnote cont">“Most of the theological words of this list [printed in App. <a href="#a.xiv">xiv</a>.] are Sanskrit, and afford proof sufficient, if any were needed, of the former prevalence
of the Hindu religion among the Malays and Javanese. Many of them are more or less
corrupted in orthography, owing to the defective pronunciation and defective alphabets
of the Archipelago. Some, also, are altered or varied in sense. <i lang="ms">Tapas</i>, ‘ascetic devotion,’ is deprived of its last consonant and becomes <i lang="ms">tapa</i>. <i lang="ms">Avatar</i>, ‘a descent,’ is converted into <i lang="ms">batara</i>; and instead of implying the descent or incarnation of a deity, is used as an appellative
for any of the principal Hindu deities. Combined with <i lang="ms">guru</i>, also Sanskrit, it is the most current name of the chief god of the Hindus, worshipped
by the Indian islanders, supposed to have been Vishnu, or the preserving power. It
may be translated “the spiritual guide god,” or, perhaps, literally “the god of the
spiritual guides,” that is, of the Brahmins. <i lang="ms">Agama</i> in Sanskrit is “authority for religious doctrine”; in Malay and Javanese it is religion
itself, and is at present applied both to the Mahomedan and the Christian religions.
With nearly the same orthography, and in the same sense, Sanskrit words, as far as
they extend, are used throughout the Archipelago, and even as far as the Philippines.”—Crawfurd,

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e5280src">21</a></span> The following account of Genii (printed in the <i>Selangor Journal</i>, vol. i. No. 7, p. 102) was given me by a Mecca pilgrim or “Haji.” This man was a
native of Java who had spent several years in the Malay Peninsula, and as Mecca is
the goal of the pilgrimage to all good Muhammadans alike, it is important to know
something of the ideas which are there disseminated, and with which the Malay pilgrim
would be likely to come in contact. “In the unseen world the place of first importance
must be accorded, on account of their immense numbers, to the ‘Jins’ (the ‘Genii’
of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>).”
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“The Javanese, drawing a slightly stronger line of distinction (than that of good
and bad genii in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>), call these two (separate) classes the Jin Islam and the Jin Kafir, or the Faithful
and the Infidel. Of these two classes, the former shrink from whatever is unclean,
and the latter only will approach the Chinese, to whom the Jin Islam manifests the
strongest repugnance. The good genii are perfectly formed in the fashion of a man,
but are, of course, impalpable as air, though they have a voice like mortals. They
live in a mosque of their own, which they never leave, and where they offer up unceasing
prayers. This mosque is built of stone, and stands beside a lake called ‘Kolam Yamani’;
into this lake the whole of the waters from the neighbouring country drain, and the
overflow runs down to the sea. In this lake the good genii bathe, and if any wicked
or childless mortals bathe in it they carry them off and detain them in the mosque
until they (the mortals) have shown proof of their reformed character by continuing
for a long while without committing a wrong action, when they are sent back in safety
to their native land. I should add that the Jin Islam exact tribute from the unfaithful—<i>e.g.</i> Chinamen—and if they do not receive their due, they will steal it and give it to
a son of Islam. [They may be bought from the “Sheikh Jin” at Mecca for prices varying
from $90 to $100 each.]

they are dumb.

<p class="footnote cont">“Great as their numbers are they are continually increasing, as they are suffered
by God to get children after their kind. They are imps of mischief, and their whole
time is spent in works of malice. Sometimes when there has been a long drought and
a heavy shower of rain is poured down upon the earth by the angels at the bidding
of God to cool the parched verdure, they will assemble their legions, bringing with
them invisible cocoa-nut shells, one for each drop of rain. In these they catch each
rain-drop as it falls, and herbs and trees alike wither for lack of moisture. Then
the angels being wroth, cast thunderbolts upon them out of heaven, and these malicious
elves take shelter in tall trees, which the thunderbolts blast in their fall. At another
time they will climb one upon the other’s shoulders until they reach the sky, when
the topmost elf kicks a neighbouring angel, and then they all fall together with a
crash like thunder.”&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e5280src" title="Return to note 21 in text.">↑</a></p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The chief features of the Bird-lore of the Peninsular Malays, which, as will appear
in the course of this chapter, is strongly tinged with animism, have been thus described
by Sir William Maxwell:—
</p>
<p>“Ideas of various characters are associated by Malays with birds of different kinds,
and many of their favourite similes are furnished by the feathered world. The peacock
strutting in the jungle, the argus pheasant calling on the mountain peak, the hoot
of the owl, and the cry of the night-jar, have all suggested comparisons of various
kinds, which are embodied in the proverbs of the people.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6107src" href="#xd32e6107">10</a> The Malay <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>is a keen observer of nature, and his illustrations, drawn from such sources, are
generally just and often poetical.
</p>
<p>“The supernatural bird <i lang="ms">Gerda</i> (Garuda, the eagle of Vishnu), who figures frequently in Malay romances, is dimly
known to the Malay peasant. If, during the day, the sun is suddenly overcast by clouds
and shadow succeeds to brilliancy, the Pêrak Malay will say “<i lang="ms">Gerda</i> is spreading out his wings to dry.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6201src" href="#xd32e6201">11</a> Tales are told, too, of other fabulous birds<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6205src" href="#xd32e6205">12</a>—the <i lang="ms">jintayu</i>, which is never seen, though its note is heard, and which announces the approach
of rain;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6239src" href="#xd32e6239">13</a> and the <i lang="ms">chandrawasi</i>, which has no feet. The <i lang="ms">chandrawasi</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>lives in the air, and is constantly on the wing, never descending to earth or alighting
on a tree. Its young even are produced without the necessity of touching the earth.
The egg is allowed to drop, and as it nears the earth it bursts, and the young bird
appears fully developed. The note of the <i lang="ms">chandrawasi</i> may often be heard at night, but never by day, and it is lucky, say the Malays, to
halt at a spot where it is heard calling.
</p>
<p>“There is an allusion to this bird in a common <i lang="ms">pantun</i>—a kind of erotic stanza very popular among the Malays:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“<i lang="ms">Chandrawasi burong sakti,</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i lang="ms">Sangat berkurong didalam awan.</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i lang="ms">Gonda gulana didalam hati,</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i lang="ms">Sahari tidak memandang tuan.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6286src" href="#xd32e6286">14</a> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">“Nocturnal birds are generally considered ill-omened all over the world, and popular
superstition among the Malays fosters a prejudice against one species of owl. If it
happens to alight and hoot near a house, the inhabitants say significantly that there
will soon be <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>‘tearing of cloth’ (<i lang="ms">koyah kapan</i>) for a shroud. This does not apply to the small owl called <i lang="ms">punggok</i>, which, as soon as the moon rises, may often be heard to emit a soft plaintive note.
The note of the <i lang="ms">punggok</i> is admired by the Malays, who suppose it to be sighing for the moon, and find in
it an apt simile for a desponding lover.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">baberek</i> or <i lang="ms">birik-birik</i>, another nocturnal bird, is a harbinger of misfortune. This bird is said to fly in
flocks at night; it has a peculiar note, and a passing flock makes a good deal of
noise. If these birds are heard passing, the Pêrak peasant brings out a <i lang="ms">sĕngkalan</i> (a wooden platter on which spices are ground), and beats it with a knife, or other
domestic utensil, calling out as he does so: “<i lang="ms">Nenek, bawa hati-nia</i>” (“Great-grandfather, bring us their hearts”). This is an allusion to the belief
that the bird <i lang="ms">baberek</i> flies in the train of the Spectre Huntsman (<i lang="ms">hantu pemburu</i>), who roams Malay forests with several ghostly dogs, and whose appearance is the
forerunner of disease or death. “Bring us their hearts” is a mode of asking for some
of his game, and it is hoped that the request will delude the <i lang="ms">hantu pemburu</i> into the belief that the applicants are <i lang="ms">raʿiyat</i>, or followers of his, and that he will, therefore, spare the household.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">baberek</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6404src" href="#xd32e6404">15</a> which flies with the wild hunt, bears a striking resemblance to the white owl, <i lang="ms">Totosel</i>, the nun who broke her vow, and now mingles her “tutu” with the “holloa” of the Wild
Huntsman of the Harz.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6418src" href="#xd32e6418">16</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The legend of the Spectre Huntsman is thus told by the Pêrak Malays:—
</p>
<p>“In former days, at Katapang, in Sumatra, there lived a man whose wife, during her
pregnancy, was seized with a violent longing for the meat of the <i lang="ms">pelandok</i> (mouse-deer). But it was no ordinary <i lang="ms">pelandok</i> that she wanted. She insisted that it should be a doe, big with male offspring, and
she bade her husband go and seek in the jungle for what she wanted. The man took his
weapons and dogs and started, but his quest was fruitless, for he had misunderstood
his wife’s injunctions, and what he sought was a <i>buck pelandok</i>, big with male offspring, an unheard-of prodigy.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Day and night he hunted, slaying innumerable mouse-deer, which he threw away on finding
that they did not fulfil the conditions required.
</p>
<p>“He had sworn a solemn oath on leaving home that he would not return unsuccessful,
so he became a regular denizen of the forest, eating the flesh and drinking the blood
of the animals which he slew, and pursuing night and day his fruitless search. At
length he said to himself: ‘I have hunted the whole earth over without finding what
I want; it is now time to try the firmament.’ So he holloa’d on his dogs through the
sky, while he walked below on the earth looking up at them, and after a long time,
the hunt still being unsuccessful, the back of his head, from constantly gazing upwards,
became fixed to his back, and he was no longer able to look down at the earth. One
day a leaf from the tree called <i lang="ms">Si Limbak</i> fell on his throat and took root there, and a straight shoot grew upwards in front
of his face.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6509src" href="#xd32e6509">19</a> In this state he still hunts through Malay forests, urging on his dogs as they hunt
through the sky, with his gaze evermore turned upwards.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6512src" href="#xd32e6512">20</a>
</p>
<p>“His wife, whom he left behind when he started on the fatal chase, was delivered in
due time of two children—a boy and a girl. When they were old enough to play with
other children, it chanced one day that the boy quarrelled with the child of a neighbour
with whom he was playing. The latter reproached him with his father’s fate, of which
the child had hitherto <span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>been ignorant, saying: ‘Thou art like thy father, who has become an evil spirit, ranging
the forests day and night, and eating and drinking no man knows how. Get thee to thy
father.’
</p>
<p>“Then the boy ran crying to his mother and related what had been said to him. ‘Do
not cry,’ said she, ‘it is true, alas! that thy father has become a spirit of evil.’
On this the boy cried all the more, and begged to be allowed to join his father. His
mother yielded at last to his entreaties, and told him the name of his father and
the names of the dogs. He might be known, she said, by his habit of gazing fixedly
at the sky and by his four weapons—a blow-pipe (<i lang="ms">sumpitan</i>), a spear, a <i lang="ms">kris</i>, and a sword (<i lang="ms">klewang</i>). ‘And,’ added she, ‘when thou hearest the hunt approaching, call upon him and the
dogs by name, and repeat thy own name and mine, so that he may know thee.’
</p>
<p>“The boy entered the forest, and, after he had walked some way, met an old man who
asked him where he was going. ‘I go to join my father,’ said the lad. ‘If thou findest
him,’ said the old man, ‘ask him where he has put my chisel which he has borrowed
from me.’ This the boy promised to do, and continued his journey. After he had gone
a long way he heard sounds like those made by people engaged in hunting. As they approached,
he repeated the names which his mother had told him, and immediately found himself
face to face with his father. The hunter demanded of him who he was, and the child
repeated all that his mother had told him, not forgetting the message of the old man
about the chisel. Then the hunter said: ‘Truly thou art my son. As for the chisel,
it is true that when I started from home I was in the middle of shaping some bamboos
to make steps for the house. <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>I put the chisel inside one of the bamboos. Take it and return it to the owner. Return
now and take care of thy mother and sister. As for him who reproached thee, hereafter
we will repay him. I will eat his heart and drink his blood, so shall he be rewarded.’
</p>
<p>“From that time forward the Spectre Huntsman has afflicted mankind, and many are those
whom he has destroyed. Before dismissing his son, he desired him to warn all his kindred
never to use bamboo for making steps for a house, and never to hang clothes to dry
from poles stuck in between the joists supporting the floor, and thus jutting out
at right angles with a house, ‘lest,’ said he, ‘I should strike against such poles
as I walk along. Further,’ he continued, ‘when ye hear the note of the bird <i lang="ms">birik-birik</i> at night, ye will know that I am walking near.’

quarry.

</p>
<p>“Then the boy returned to his mother and delivered to her and all their kindred the
injunctions of the lost man. One account says that the woman followed her spectre
husband to the forest, where she joins in the chase with him to this day, and that
they have there children born in the woods. The first boy and girl retained their
human form, according to this account, but some <i lang="ms">Pawangs</i> say that the whole family are in the forest with the father.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6578src" href="#xd32e6578">21</a>
</p>
<p>“Numerous <i lang="ms">mantra</i>, or charms, against the evil influence of the Wild Huntsman are in use among the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>Pawangs, or medicine-men of Pêrak. These are repeated, accompanied by appropriate
ceremonies, when the disease from which some sick person is suffering has been traced
to an encounter with the <i lang="ms">hantu pemburu</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6616src" href="#xd32e6616">22</a>

<p class="first">“In charms intended to guard him who repeats them, or who wears them written on paper,
against the evil influences of the Spectre Huntsman, the names of the dogs, weapons,
etc., constantly vary. The origin of the dreaded demon is always, however, ascribed
to Katapang<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6702src" href="#xd32e6702">23</a> in Sumatra. This superstition strikingly resembles the European legends of the Wild
Huntsman, whose shouts the trembling peasants hear above the storm. It is, no doubt,
of Aryan origin, and, coming to the Peninsula from Sumatra, seems to corroborate existing
evidence tending to show that it is partly through Sumatra that the Peninsula has
received Aryan myths and Indian phraseology. A superstitious prejudice against the
use of bamboo in making a step-ladder for a Malay house and against drying clothes
outside a house on poles stuck into the framework, exists in full force among the
Pêrak Malays.
</p>
<p>“The note of the <i lang="ms">birik-birik</i> at night, telling as it does of the approach of the <i lang="ms">hantu pemburu</i>, is listened to with the utmost dread and misgiving. The Bataks in Sumatra call this
bird by the same name—<i lang="ms">birik-birik</i>. It is noticeable that in Batak legends regarding the creation of the world, the
origin of mankind is ascribed <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>to <i lang="ms">Putri-Orta-Bulan</i>, the daughter of <i lang="ms">Batara-Guru</i>, who descended to the earth <i>with a white owl and a dog</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6732src" href="#xd32e6732">24</a>
</p>
<p>To the information contained in the foregoing passage I would add the following observations:—
</p>
<p>Charms for neutralising the power of the Spectre Huntsman are by no means uncommon,
and though they almost invariably differ in unimportant details, such as the names
of his dogs and weapons, they still bear strong and unmistakable family likeness.
Still there are some versions which contain important divergencies (two or three of
these versions will be found in the Appendix), and it will only be after the diligent
collation and compilation of a great many versions that the real germ or nucleus of
the myth as known to the Malays will be clearly apparent.
</p>
<p>One of the charms given in the Appendix evidently alludes to a different version of
the story; the lines which contain the allusion being as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“I know your origin, O man of penance,
</p>
<p class="line">Whose dwelling was upon the hill of Mount Ophir,
</p>
<p class="line">[You sprang] from a son of the Prophet Joseph who was wroth with his mother,
</p>
<p class="line">Because she would eat the hearts of the birds of Paradise.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Yet even here, if we except the obvious interpolation of the reference to the “son
of the Prophet Joseph,” the task of reconciling the conflicting versions may be easier
than would appear at first sight.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6748src" href="#xd32e6748">25</a>
</p>
<p>A still more curious deviation occurs in another version,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6757src" href="#xd32e6757">26</a> where the Spectre Huntsman’s poniard and <i lang="ms">k’ris</i> are declared to be the insignia of the great Spirit-King Rama. The passage is as
follows:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“With a blind crow as his guide,
</p>
<p class="line">The giant demon, Si Adunada,
</p>
<p class="line">Carries (his weapons) slung over his shoulder with back bent double.
</p>
<p class="line"><i>Salampuri</i> is the name of his poniard (<i lang="ms">sĕkin</i>),
</p>
<p class="line"><i>Silambuara</i> the name of his <i lang="ms">k’ris</i>,
</p>
<p class="line">The insignia of the Demon Rama.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">That it is his <i>weapons</i> which the Spectre Huntsman’s son (Adunada) carries on his back appears from a passage
below, which runs:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O Si Adunada, with the sword slung at your back,
</p>
<p class="line">Bent double you come from the lightwood swamps,
</p>
<p class="line">We did not guess that you were here.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This reference to Rama opens up a long vista of possibilities, but for the present
it will be sufficient to remark that the Spectre Huntsman himself is almost universally
declared by the Malays to be the King of the Land-folk (<i lang="ms">Raja orang darat</i>). It is on account of this kingship that his weapons receive distinguishing titles
such as are given to royal weapons. This, too, is the reason that he is so much more
dreaded by Malays than ordinary spirits of evil; his mere touch being considered sufficient
to kill, by the exercise of that divine power which all Malay Rajas are held to possess.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6798src" href="#xd32e6798">27</a>
</p>
<p>To return from the foregoing digression: there are many other curious legends connected
with Birds. Thus, in 1882, Captain Kelham wrote as follows:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>“From Mr. W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell, H.M. Assistant Resident, of Lârut, I hear that the Malays
have a strange legend connected with one of the large Hornbills; but which species
I was not able to find out. It is as follows:—
</p>
<p>“ ‘A Malay, in order to be revenged on his mother-in-law (why, the legend does not
relate), shouldered his axe and made his way to the poor woman’s house, and began
to cut through the posts which supported it. After a few steady chops the whole edifice
came tumbling down, and he greeted its fall with a peal of laughter. To punish him
for his unnatural conduct he was turned into a bird, and the <i lang="ms">tebang mentuah</i> (literally, He who chopped down his mother-in-law) may often be heard in the jungle
uttering a series of sharp sounds like the chop of an axe on timber, followed by Ha!
ha! ha!’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6819src" href="#xd32e6819">28</a>
</p>
<p>The following account of the bird-lore of the Malay Peninsula was compiled by me from
notes supplied to the <i>Selangor Journal</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6836src" href="#xd32e6836">29</a> by the late Sir William Maxwell:—
</p>
<p>The Night-jar (<i lang="ms">Burong chĕroh</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6843src" href="#xd32e6843">30</a>) takes its name from the word applied to the second stage in the operation of husking
rice. Malay women husk rice by pounding it in a mortar with a wooden pestle. The husked
grain is then commonly winnowed in a sieve, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>the unhusked rice (<i lang="ms">antah</i>) which remains has to be separated from the husked rice and pounded over again. The
second process, which is called <i lang="ms">ckĕroh</i>, is that from which the night-jar derives its name, the quick fancy of the Malay
hearing in the note of the bird the slow measured stroke of a pestle (<i lang="ms">antan</i>) descending in a mortar (<i lang="ms">lĕsong</i>). This is possibly the foundation of the legend that the Night-jar is a woman who,
while engaged in husking rice by moonlight, was turned into a bird in consequence
of a quarrel with her mother. Another name for the night-jar is <i lang="ms">burong chempak</i>.
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">Burong sĕpah putri</i> (“Princess’s betel-quid”) belongs to the Honey-birds or Bee-eaters, of which there
are several species, remarkable chiefly for their brilliant metallic plumage. [A quaint
story is told in explanation of its name: once upon a time the Owl (<i lang="ms">ponggok</i>) fell in love with the Princess of the Moon (Pŭtri Bulan) and asked her to marry
him. She promised to do so, if he would allow her first to finish her quid of betel
undisturbed; but before finishing it she threw it down to the earth, where it took
the form of the small bird in question. The Princess then requested the Owl to make
search for it, but as, of course, he was unable to find it, the proposed match fell
through. This is the reason why the Owl, to quote the Malay proverb, “sighs longingly
to the Moon,” and is the type of the plaintive lover.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6876src" href="#xd32e6876">31</a>]
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">Burong tinggal anak</i> (lit. “Good-bye, children” bird) is a small bird whose note is to be heard at the
season when the young rice is sprouting (<i lang="ms">musim padi pĕchah anak</i>). As soon as her young are hatched out this bird dies in the nest, repeating the
words <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>“<i lang="ms">Tinggal anak</i>” (“Good-bye, children”), and the maggots which breed in her corpse afford an unnatural
nourishment to her unsuspecting offspring.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Burong diam ’kau Tuah</i>, or “Hold your peace, Tuah,” is the name of a small bird which is said to repeat
the words—
</p>
<div lang="ms" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“<i>Diam ’kau, Tuah,</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i>K’ris aku ada</i>,”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">or,
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Hold thy peace, Tuah,
</p>
<p class="line">My <i lang="ms">k’ris</i> (dagger) is with me.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The story runs that once upon a time there was a man who had a slave called Tuah,
who answered him back, and with whom he accordingly found fault, using the words given
above. In the transport of his rage he was turned into a bird.
</p>
<p>The bird called <i lang="ms">Kuau</i> in Perak (<i lang="ms">kuau</i> is the name given in Malacca and Selangor to the argus pheasant, which in Perak is
called <i lang="ms">kuang</i>) is about the size of the mynah (<i lang="ms">gambala kĕrbau</i>), and is said to have been metamorphosed from a woman, the reason of whose transformation
is not known. It is said to be unknown on the right bank of the Perak River.
</p>
<p>The “ ‘<i lang="ms">Kap-kap</i>’ bird” is the name of a night-bird of evil omen, whose note heard at night prognosticates
death.
</p>
<p>The Tearer of the shroud (<i lang="ms">Burong charik kapan</i>) is also a night-bird, with a slow, deliberate note which the Malays declare sounds
exactly like the tearing of cloth.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6939src" href="#xd32e6939">32</a> This signifies the tearing of the shroud, and unerringly forebodes death. Yet another
night-bird ominous of approaching dissolution is the <i lang="ms">Tumbok larong</i>. This bird, like the two preceding, <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>is probably a variety of owl; the first and third are only found inland at a distance
from the sea.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">’Toh katampi</i> (“Old-man-winnow-the-rice-for-the-burial-feast,” as Sir Frank Swettenham calls him,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6953src" href="#xd32e6953">33</a>) is a species of horned owl, which derives its name from a word meaning to winnow
(<i lang="ms">tampi</i>, <i lang="ms">mĕnampi</i>). Malays say that this bird has a habit of treading upon the extremities of its own
wings, and fluttering the upper part while thus holding them down. This singular habit
produces a sound resembling that of winnowing.
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">’Toh katampi</i> is larger than the <i lang="ms">Jampuk</i>, another species of owl, which is popularly supposed to enter the fowl-house and
there live on the intestines of fowls, which it extracts during life by means of a
certain charm (<i lang="ms">ʿelmu pĕlali</i>, a charm similar to those used by the Malays for filing teeth, etc.) which it uses
in order to perform the operation painlessly.
</p>
<p>The “Luck-bird” (<i lang="ms">Burong untong</i>) is a very small white bird about the size of a canary. It builds a very small white
nest, which if found and placed in a rice-bin possesses the valuable property of securing
a good harvest to its owner. As, however, the nest is built on branches in places
difficult of access it is but rarely found, and Malays will give $10 for a genuine
specimen, while sellers are known to ask as much as $25.
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">Ruwak-ruwak</i> is a kind of Heron whose nest if discovered would give the possessor the power of
becoming invisible (<i lang="ms">alimun</i>). But as neither nest nor eggs can usually be found it is held to be childless. Yet,
however, if it is possible to approach sufficiently near, when the bird is heard calling
in the swamps, it may be seen dipping a twig or else <span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>its bent leg into the water, and accompanying its action with its call, as if it were
bathing a child on its knee; hence the Malay who hears its note says mockingly, “the
<i lang="ms">Ruwak-ruwak</i> is bathing its young one.”
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Tukang</i> is the name given in Kedah to a kind of Hornbill, which is believed to be the same
as the <i lang="ms">langlin</i> of Perak. The horn is of a yellow tinge, and is made into buttons, which, the Malays
say, turn to a livid colour whenever the wearer is about to fall sick, and black when
he is threatened by the approach of poison.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7000src" href="#xd32e7000">34</a>
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">Mĕrbu</i> (? <i lang="ms">mĕrbok</i>) is a variety of Dove which brings good luck to its owner. Instances have been known
where all the houses in a village have been burnt except that which contained a <i lang="ms">mĕrbu</i>; indeed, treatises have been written on the subject of keeping them. When the <i lang="ms">mĕrbu</i> dies its body merely shrivels up instead of breeding worms, which, it is added, would
be worth keeping as curiosities should any appear.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7018src" href="#xd32e7018">35</a>
</p>
<p>The bird called <i lang="ms">Pĕdrudang</i> is a diver which has the power of remaining under water for a very long time. It
is only to be found where the fish called <i lang="ms">kĕlĕsah</i> exist in large quantities. The eggs of the <i lang="ms">kĕlĕsah</i> are of great size, and the Malays say, <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>therefore, that it cohabits with the <i lang="ms">pĕdrudang</i>. These eggs are considered a delicacy by the Malays, who make them into a sort of
custard pudding (<i lang="ms">s’ri-kaya</i>).
</p>
<p>To the Ground-pigeon (<i lang="ms">Tĕkukur</i>) belongs the following story:—“Once upon a time there was a maiden who lived in the
forest with her parents and little sister. When she grew up she was troubled by an
anxiety to accompany her father in his expeditions to the forest, where he was engaged
in clearing the ground for a rice-plantation. Her parents, however, persuaded her
to stay at home; first until the trees were felled, then until the fallen timber had
been burnt off, then till the rice had been planted, and then again till it was cut.
When, however, they attempted to put her off yet once more, until the rice should
be trodden out, she could bear it no longer, and taking off her bracelets and earrings,
which she left behind the door, and placing her little sister in the swinging-cot,
she changed herself into a ground-dove and flew away to the clearing. [She retained
her necklace, however, and this accounts for the speckled marks on this dove’s neck.]
On arriving at the spot where her parents were engaged at work, she alighted on a
dead tree stump (<i lang="ms">changgong</i>), and called out thrice to her mother, ‘Mother, mother, I have left my earrings and
bracelets behind the door, and have put my little sister in the swing.’ Her mother,
amazed at these words, hastened home, and found her daughter gone. She then returned
to the bird, which repeated the same words as before, this time, however, concluding
with the coo of a dove. In vain the distressed parents endeavoured to recapture her,
by cutting down the tree on which she had perched; before <span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>they had done so she flew to another, and after following her from tree to tree for
several miles they were obliged to desist, and she was never recaptured.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7073src" href="#xd32e7073">36</a>
</p>
<p>The following notes on birds are taken from a reprint<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7090src" href="#xd32e7090">37</a> of “Museum Notes” by Mr. L. Wray, jun., the official curator of the Perak Museum.
Mr. Wray says:—
</p>
<p>“The Weaver-bird, which makes the long hanging bottle-shaped nests occasionally seen
hanging from the branches of a low tree, is said to use a golden needle in the work;
and it is affirmed that if the nest is carefully picked to pieces, without breaking
any part of it, the needle will be found; but if it is pulled ruthlessly apart, or
if even a single piece of the grass of which it is made is broken in unravelling it,
the golden needle will disappear. The makers of these curious and beautiful nests
are said to always choose trees that are infested with red ants or wasps, or which
grow in impassable swamps.”
</p>
<p>The Weaver-bird (<i lang="la">Ploceus Baya</i>, Blyth) is called (in Selangor) <i lang="ms">Burong Tĕmpua</i> or <i lang="ms">Chiak Raya</i>. It is said to use only the long jungle grass called <i lang="ms">lalang</i> for making its nest, which latter is called <i lang="ms">buah rabun</i>, and is used by the Malays for polishing sheaths and scabbards. When an infant keeps
crying, one of the parents takes the weaver-bird’s nest, reduces it to ashes, and
fumigates the child by thrice moving it round in a circle over the smoke. Whilst doing
so, the parent either stands up with the right toe resting upon the toe of the left
foot, or else squats <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>upon the left heel, bending the right knee, and saying, ‘As the weaver-bird’s young
in its nest, so rest and weep not’ (<i lang="ms">Bagimana anak tĕmpua dalam sarang-nya, bagitu-lah ’kau diam jangan mĕnangis</i>). To the above I may add that besides the ordinary bottle-shaped nest, the weaver-birds
also occasionally make a hood-shaped, or rather a helmet-shaped nest, which is alleged
by the Malays to be the male bird’s ‘swing’ (<i lang="ms">buayan</i>). This ‘swing’ resembles the upper half of an ordinary bottle-shaped nest, with a
perch across it, which latter is also woven of grass. On the walls of the swing, just
over each end of the perch, is a small daub of clay. The Malays allege that the male
bird swings in it while the hen bird is sitting, and that the young too ‘take the
air’ in it as soon as they are able to fly so far. Into the two daubs of mud over
the perch the male bird (say the Malays) sticks fire-flies to give itself light at
night.
</p>
<p>“The King crow<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7124src" href="#xd32e7124">38</a> is called by the Malays the Slave of the Monkeys (<i lang="ms">Burong hamba kra</i>). It is a pretty, active, noisy little bird, incessantly flying about with its two
long racquet-shaped tail feathers fluttering after it. They say that when it has both
of these feathers it has paid off its debt and is free, but when it is either destitute
of these appendages, or has only one, it is still in bondage.
</p>
<p>“The Gray Sea-eagle<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7134src" href="#xd32e7134">39</a> is called <i lang="ms">Burong hamba siput</i> ‘the Slave of the Shell-fish,’ and its office is to give warning by screaming to
the shell-fish of the changes of the tide, so that they may regulate their movements,
and those species which crawl about on the mud at low water may know when to take
refuge <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>in the trees and escape the rising tide, or when the tide is falling, that they may
know when to descend to look for food.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">Burong dĕmam</i>, or ‘Fever bird,’ is so called from its loud, tremulous note, and the Malays say
that the female bird calls in its fever-stricken voice to its mate to go and find
food, because it has fever so badly that it cannot go itself. This bird is probably
one of the large green barbets. The note is often heard, and doubtless the bird has
been collected, but it is one thing shooting a bird and another identifying it as
the producer of a certain note.
</p>
<p>“Another bird, the White-breasted Water-hen, a frequenter of the edges of reedy pools
and the marshy banks of streams, is reputed to build a nest on the ground which has
the property of rendering any one invisible who puts it on his head. The prevailing
idea among the Malays is that the proper and legitimate use to put it to is to steal
money and other species of property.”
</p>
<p>The next few notes on Malay bird-lore were collected by the writer in Selangor:—
</p>
<p>The Toucan or small Hornbill (<i lang="ms">Ĕnggang</i>) was metamorphosed from a man who, in conjunction with a companion, broke into the
house of an old man living by himself in the jungle, and slew him for the sake of
his wealth. When life was extinct they threw a sheet over the body, and proceeded
to ransack the house, throwing the loot into a second sheet close to the corpse. Day
was about to dawn, when a false alarm induced them to make a hurried departure, so
that they picked up the sheet with their loot and made off with it, carrying it slung
hastily upon a pole between them. As they proceeded on their way day commenced <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>gradually to dawn, and the man behind noticing something unexpected about the bundle,
and divining the cause, called out to his companion “<i lang="ms">Orang!</i>” (pr. <i>o rang</i>) “The man!” His companion, misunderstanding his exclamation, thought he meant that
they were pursued by “<i>a</i> man,” and only went all the faster, until, on hearing his comrade repeat the cry
a second and a third time, he turned round, and there saw the feet of the man he had
murdered protruding from the sheet, a sight which startled him to such a degree that
he turned into a bird upon the spot, and flew away into a tree, repeating as he went
the fatal cry of “O’Rang! ’Rang!” which had caused the transformation. And to this
day, whenever the Malay hears among the tree-tops the cry of “’Rang! ’rang!” he knows
that he is listening to the cry of the murderer.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7167src" href="#xd32e7167">40</a>
</p>
<p>The Argus-pheasant<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7175src" href="#xd32e7175">41</a> and the Crow<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7180src" href="#xd32e7180">42</a> in the days of King Solomon were bosom friends, and could never do enough to show
their mutual friendship. One day, however, the argus-pheasant, who was then dressed
somewhat dowdily, suggested that his friend the crow should show his skill with the
brush by decorating his (the argus-pheasant’s) feathers. To this the crow agreed,
on condition, however, that the arrangement should be mutual. The argus-pheasant agreed
to this, and the crow forthwith set to work, and so surpassed himself that the argus-pheasant
became, as it is now, one of the most beautiful birds in the world. When the crow’s
task was done, however, the argus-pheasant <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>refused to fulfil his own part of the bargain, excusing himself on the plea that the
day of judgment was too near at hand. Hence a fierce quarrel ensued, at the end of
which the argus-pheasant upset the ink-bottle over the crow, and thus rendered him
coal-black.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7187src" href="#xd32e7187">43</a> Hence the crow and the argus-pheasant are enemies to this day.
</p>
<p>The bird called “<i lang="ms">Barau-barau</i>” is said to have once been a <i lang="ms">bidan</i> (midwife) whose employers (<i lang="ms">anak bidan</i>) refused to pay her for her services, and kept constantly putting her off. Her patience,
however, had its limits, and one day, after experiencing the usual evasion, she broke
out into a torrent of intemperate language, in the midst of which she was changed
into a bird, whose querulous note may be recognised as the voice of the aged woman
as she cries out for the payment of her just wages.
</p>
<p>About the big Kingfisher (<i lang="ms">Pĕkaka</i>) an amusing parallel to the fable of the Fox and the Crow is related. It is said
that this kingfisher once caught a fish, and flew to a low branch just overhanging
the water to devour it. The fish, seeking for a means to save his life, decided to
try the effect of a speech, and accordingly addressed his captor in the following
verses, judiciously designed to appeal at once to her vanity and compassion:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O Kingfisher! Kingfisher!
</p>
<p class="line">What a glistening, glittering beak!
</p>
<p class="line">Yet while you, Big Sister, are filling your maw,
</p>
<p class="line">Little Brother will lose his life.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">At this critical juncture the Kingfisher opens her beak <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>to laugh, and the fish slips back into his native element and escapes!
</p>
<div class="div4 last-child section">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><i>Fowling Ceremonies</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ideas of sympathetic magic run very strongly through all ceremonies connected with
the taking of wild birds, such for instance as jungle-fowl or pigeon.
</p>
<p>The commonest method of snaring jungle-fowl is to take a line (called <i lang="ms">rachik</i>), with a great number of fine nooses attached to it, and set it so as to form a complete
circle, enclosing an open space in the forest. You must bring a decoy-bird with you,
and the instructions which I collected say that you should on arriving enter the circle,
<i>holding the bird like a fighting cock</i>, and repeat these lines:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ho, Si Lanang, Si Tĕmpawi,
</p>
<p class="line">Come and let us play at cock-fighting
</p>
<p class="line">On the border-line between the primary and secondary forest-growth.
</p>
<p class="line">Your cock, Grandsire, is <i>spurred with steel</i>.
</p>
<p class="line">Mine is but <i>spurred with bamboo</i>.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here deposit the bird upon the ground. The challenge of the decoy-bird will then attract
the jungle-fowl from all directions, and as they try to enter the circle (in order
to reach the decoy), they will entangle themselves in the nooses.
</p>
<p>As often as you succeed, however, in catching one, you must be careful to cast the
“mischief” out of it, using the same form of words as is used to drive the “mischief”
out of the carcase of the deer.
</p>
<p>The method of catching wild pigeon is much more elaborate, and brings the animistic
ideas of the Malays into strong relief, the “souls” of the wild pigeon being repeatedly
referred to.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure plate04width" id="plate04"><img src="images/plate04.jpg" alt="Plate 4.—Pigeon Decoy Hut." width="579" height="423"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Plate 4.—Pigeon Decoy Hut.</span></p>
<p class="first">Used in snaring wild pigeon.
</p>
<p><i>Page 133.</i></p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>First you build a small sugar-loaf (conical) hut (called <i lang="ms">bumbun</i>) in a carefully selected spot in the jungle. This hut may be from four to five feet
high, is strongly built of stakes converging to a point at the top, and is thickly
thatched with leaves and branches. The reason for making it strong is that there is
always an off-chance that you may receive a visit from a tiger. At the back of the
hut you must leave a small square opening (it can hardly be dignified with the name
of a door), about two feet high and with a flap to it, through which you can creep
into the hut on your hands and knees. [I may remark, parenthetically, that you will
find the hut very damp, very dark, and very full of mosquitoes, and that if you are
wise you will take with you a small stock of cigarettes.] In front of the hut, that
is to say, on the side away from the door, if you want to proceed in the orthodox
way, you will have to clear a small rectangular space, and put up round it on three
sides (right, left, and front opposite the hut) a low railing consisting of a single
bar about 18 inches from the ground. This is to rail off what is called “King Solomon’s
Palace-yard,” and will also be useful from a practical point of view, as it will serve
as a perch for your “decoy.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7256src" href="#xd32e7256">44</a>
</p>
<p>The instructions proceed as follows:—
</p>
<p>Before entering the hut the wizard must go through what is called the “Neutralising
Rice-paste” <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>) ceremony, first in the centre of the enclosed space, and then in each corner successively,
beating each of the forked sticks (uprights) at the corners with a bunch of leaves.
He must then take the decoy-tube, and after reciting the appropriate charm, sound
a long-drawn note in each corner successively, and then insert the mouth-end of it
into the hut through a hole in the thatch, supporting the heavy outer end upon a forked
upright stick. Then entering the hut, he slips the noose at the end of the decoy-bird’s
rod on to the decoy-bird’s feet, and pushing the bird out through the front door of
the hut, makes it flutter on to one of the horizontal rods, where it will sit, if
well trained, and call its companions. After a time the decoy-bird’s challenge is
met by first one and then many counter challenges, then the wild pigeon approach,
there is a great fluttering of wings, and presently one of the first arrivals flies
down and commences to walk round and round the hut. Then the wizard awaits his opportunity,
and as the pigeon passes in front of the door he pushes out one of the rods with a
noose at the end, slips the noose over the bird’s neck or feet, and drags it into
the hut.
</p>
<p>The hut must be used, if possible, before the leaves with which it is thatched have
faded, as the wild pigeon are less likely to be suspicious of the hut when its thatch
is green.
</p>
<p>In the way just described any number of pigeon can be taken, a bag of twenty or thirty
being a fair average for a day’s work under favourable conditions.
</p>
<p>The “call” will occasionally, for some unexplained reason, attract to the spot wild
animals such as deer <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>(especially mouse-deer) and tigers. Is it not possible that the story of the lute
of Orpheus may have had its origin in some old hunting custom of the kind?
</p>
<p>The following are specimens of the charms used by the wizard:—
</p>
<p>When you are about to start (to decoy pigeons) say—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“It is not I who am setting out,
</p>
<p class="line">It is ’Toh Bujang Sibor<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7302src" href="#xd32e7302">45</a> who is setting out.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then sound the decoy-tube (<i lang="ms">buluh dĕkut</i>) thrice loudly, and say—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“I pray that they (the <span class="corr" id="xd32e7315" title="Source: pigeon">pigeons</span>) may come in procession, come in succession,
</p>
<p class="line">To enter into this bundle<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7320src" href="#xd32e7320">46</a> of ours.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Now set out, and when you reach the conical hut (<i lang="ms">bumbun</i>) say—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“My hut’s name is the Magic Prince,

</div>
<p class="first">Or else when you first reach the hut, “take the (leaves of) the branch of a tree which
is as high as your head, the leaves of the branch of a tree which is as high as your
waist, the leaves of the branch of a tree which is as high as your knee, and the leaves
of a tree which is only as high as your ankle-joint. Make them <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>all into a bunch, and with them “flick” the outside of the hut, saying these lines—

<p class="first">Put your lips to the decoy-tube, and sound the call, saying—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Cut the <i lang="ms">mĕngkudu</i> stem;
</p>
<p class="line">Cut it (through) and thrust it downwards,” etc. (as before).</p>
</div>
<p class="first">(or else some longer version, such as one of those given in the Appendix). When the
wild pigeon have arrived and have entered the enclosure or “Palace-yard,” wait till
they are in a good position, and then push out one of the rods with the fine noose
at the end, slip the noose over the bird’s neck, and drag it into the house, saying
as you do so—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“<i lang="ms">Wak-wak</i> [stands for] a heron on the kitchen shelf,
</p>
<p class="line">Covered over with the top of a cocoa-nut shell,
</p>
<p class="line">Do you move aside, Sir Bachelor, Master of the Ceremonies,
</p>
<p class="line">I wish to ensnare the necks of the race of wild doves.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Now that you understand the process of decoying pigeon with a pigeon-call, I must
explain something of the curious nomenclature used by the wizard; for during the ceremony
you must never call a spade a spade. In the first place, the hut must not on any account
be mentioned as such: it is to be called the Magic Prince—why so called, it is hard
to say, but most likely the name is used in allusion to the wizard who is concealed
inside it. The name given to the calling-tube itself is more appropriate, as it is
called “Prince Distraction” (Raja Gila), this name of course being an allusion to
the extraordinary fascination which it evidently exercises on the pigeon. Then the
decoy (or rather, perhaps, the rod to which it is linked) is called Pŭtri Pĕmonggo’,
or the Squatting Princess. Next to these come three Princesses which prove to be merely
the representatives of three important species of wild pigeon. Their names, though
variously given, are perhaps most commonly known as Princess “Kapor,” Princess “Sarap,”
and Princess “Puding.”
</p>
<p>Finally, even the rod used for ensnaring the pigeon has its own special name, Si Raja
Nyila (Prince Invitation).
</p>
<p>“King Solomon’s necklaces” and armlets are of course the nooses with which they are
to be snared, and which will catch them either by the neck or by the leg.
</p>
<p>The Princesses are invited to enter a gorgeous palace:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Come down, pigeons, in your myriads,
</p>
<p class="line">And perch upon the ‘Ivory Hall,’
</p>
<p class="line">(That is) carpeted with silver, and railed with amalgam,
</p>
<p class="line">(Come down) to the dishes of Her Highness Princess Lebar Nyiru (Broad-sieve).”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7554src" href="#xd32e7554">51</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The “dishes of Her Highness Princess Broad-sieve” cleverly suggest an abundance of
provender such as is likely to appeal to a hungry bird!
</p>
<p>In another version the three Princesses are invited to enter the “Palace Tower” called
“Fatimah Passes” (Mahaligei Fatimah Lalu).
</p>
<p>Moreover those who issue the invitation are no respecters of persons:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Let those which are near, arrive the first,
</p>
<p class="line">Let those which are far off be sent for,
</p>
<p class="line">Let those which have eggs, leave their eggs,
</p>
<p class="line">Those which have young, leave their young,
</p>
<p class="line">Those which are blind, be led by others,
</p>
<p class="line">Those which have broken limbs, come on crutches;
</p>
<p class="line">Come and assemble in King Solomon’s Audience-Chamber.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7573src" href="#xd32e7573">52</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">And a similar passage in another charm says—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Let those which are near, arrive the first,
</p>
<p class="line">Let those which are far off be sent for,
</p>
<p class="line">Cluck! cluck! souls of the children of forest doves,
</p>
<p class="line">Come ye down and assemble together
</p>
<p class="line">In the fold of God and King Solomon.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">If blandishments fail, however, there is to be no doubt about the punishments in store
for their wilful Highnesses: thus, a little later, we find the alternative, a thoroughgoing
imprecation calculated to “convince” the most headstrong of birds:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“I call you, I fetch you down,
</p>
<p class="line">If you come not down you shall be eaten by the Bear-cat,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">You shall be choked to death with your own feathers,
</p>
<p class="line">You shall be choked to death with a bone in your throat.
</p>
<p class="line">If you perch on a creeper you shall be entangled by it,
</p>
<p class="line">If you settle on a leaf you shall be bitten by the ‘leaf snake,’
</p>
<p class="line">Come you down quickly to God’s fold and King Solomon’s.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And an imprecation of similar import says—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“[If you do not come down, the Bear-cat shall eat you],
</p>
<p class="line">If you perch on a bough, you shall slip off it,
</p>
<p class="line">If you perch on a creeper, you shall slide off it,
</p>
<p class="line">If you perch upon a leafless stump, the stump shall fall;
</p>
<p class="line">If you settle on the ground, the ground-snake shall bite you,
</p>
<p class="line">If you soar up to heaven, the eagle shall swoop upon you.”</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">1.</span> BUILDING CEREMONIES AND CHARMS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first operation in building is the selection of the site. This is determined by
an elaborate code of rules which make the choice depend—firstly, upon the nature of
the soil with respect to colour, taste, and smell; secondly, upon the formation of
its surface; and, thirdly, upon its aspect:—
</p>
<p>“The best soil, whether for a house, village, orchard, or town, is a greenish yellow,
fragrant-scented, tart-tasting loam: such a soil will ensure abundance of gold and
silver unto the third generation.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7621src" href="#xd32e7621">53</a>
</p>
<p>“The best site, whether for a house, village, orchard, or town, is level.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7630src" href="#xd32e7630">54</a>
</p>
<p>“The best aspect (of the surface) is that of land which is low upon the north side
and high upon the south side: such a site will bring absolute peacefulness.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7635src" href="#xd32e7635">55</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>When you have found a site complying with more or less favourable conditions, in accordance
with the code, you must next clear the ground of forest or undergrowth, lay down four
sticks to form a rectangle in the centre thereof, and call upon the name of the lords
of that spot (<i>i.e.</i> the presiding local deities or spirits). Now dig up the soil (enclosed by the four
sticks), and taking a clod in your hand, call upon the lords of that spot as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ho, children of Mĕntri<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7656src" href="#xd32e7656">56</a> Guru,
</p>
<p class="line">Who dwell in the Four Corners of the World,
</p>
<p class="line">I crave this plot as a boon.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">(Here mention the purpose to which you wish to put it.)
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“If it is good, show me a good omen,
</p>
<p class="line">If it is bad, show me a bad omen.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7670src" href="#xd32e7670">57</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Wrap the clod up in white cloth, and after fumigating it with incense, place it at
night beneath your pillow, and when you retire to rest repeat the last two lines of
the above charm as before and go to sleep. If your dream is good proceed with, if
bad desist from, your operations. Supposing your dream to be “good,” you must (approximately)
clear the site of the main building and peg out the four corners with dead sticks;
then take a dead branch and heap it up lightly with earth (in the centre of the site?);
set fire to it, and when the whole heap has been reduced to ashes, sweep it all up
together and cover it over while you repeat the charm (which differs but little from
that given above). Next morning uncover it early in the morning and God will show
you the good and the bad.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>The site being finally selected, you must proceed to choose a day for erecting the
central house-post, by consulting first the schedule of lucky and unlucky months,
and next the schedule of lucky and unlucky days of the week.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7681src" href="#xd32e7681">58</a>
</p>
<p>[The best time of day for the operation to take place is said to be always seven o’clock
in the morning. Hence there seems to be no need to consult a schedule to discover
it, though some magicians may do so.]
</p>
<p>The propitious moment having been at last ascertained, the erection of the centre-post
will be proceeded with. First, the hole for its reception must be dug (the operation
being accompanied by the recital of a charm) and the post erected, the greatest precautions
being taken to prevent the shadow of any of the workers from falling either upon the
post itself or upon the hole dug to receive it, sickness and trouble being otherwise
sure to follow.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7692src" href="#xd32e7692">59</a>
</p>
<p>[The account in the Appendix, of which the above is a <i>résumé</i>, omits to describe the sacrifice which has to be made before the erection of the
centre-post, which has therefore been drawn from the instructions of other magicians.]
</p>
<p>“When the hole has been dug and before the centre-post is actually erected, some sort
of sacrifice or offering has to be made. First you take a little brazilwood (<i lang="ms">kayu sĕpang</i>), a little ebony-wood (<i lang="ms">kayu arang</i>), a little assafœtida (<i lang="ms">inggu</i>), and a little scrap-iron (<i lang="ms">tahi bĕsi</i>), and deposit them in the hole which you have dug. Then take a fowl,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7715src" href="#xd32e7715">60</a> a goat, or a buffalo [according to <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>the ascertained or reputed malignity of the locally presiding earth-demon (<i lang="ms">puaka</i>)], and cut its throat according to Muhammadan custom, spilling its blood into the
hole. Then cut off its head and feet, and deposit them within the hole to serve as
a foundation for the centre-post to rest upon (<i lang="ms">buat lapik tiang s’ri</i>). Put a ring on your little finger out of compliment to the earth-spirit (<i lang="ms">akan mĕmbujok jĕmbalang itu</i>), repeat the charm<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7730src" href="#xd32e7730">61</a> and erect the post.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7737src" href="#xd32e7737">62</a>
</p>
<p>Another form of the above ceremony was described to me by a magician as follows:—
</p>
<p>“Deposit in the hole a little scrap-iron and tin-ore, a candle nut (<i lang="ms">buah k’ras</i> or <i lang="ms">buah gorek</i>), a broken hatchet head (<i lang="ms">b’liong patah</i>), and a cent (in copper). Wait till everybody else has returned home, and, standing
close to the hole, pick up three clods (<i lang="ms">kĕpal</i>) of earth, hold them (<i lang="ms">gĕnggam</i>) over the incense, turn ‘right-about-face’ and repeat the charm.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7770src" href="#xd32e7770">63</a> Then take the three clods home (without once turning round to look behind you till
you reach home), place them under your sleeping pillow and wait till nightfall, when
you may have either a good or a bad dream. If the first night’s dream be bad, throw
away one of the clods and dream again. If the second night’s dream be <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>bad, repeat the process, and whenever you get a good dream deposit the clod or clods
under the butt-end of the centre-post to serve as a foundation.”
</p>
<p>A magician gave me this specimen of a charm used at this ceremony (of erecting the
centre-post):—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ho, Raja Guru, Maharaja Guru,
</p>
<p class="line">You are the sons of Batara Guru.
</p>
<p class="line">I know the origin from which you spring,
</p>
<p class="line">From the Flashing of Lightning’s spurs;
</p>
<p class="line">I know the origin from which you spring,
</p>
<p class="line">From the Brightening of Daybreak.
</p>
<p class="line">Ho, Spectre of the Earth, Brains of the Earth, Demon of the Earth,
</p>
<p class="line">Retire ye hence to the depths of the Ocean,
</p>
<p class="line">To the peace of the primeval forest.
</p>
<p class="line">Betwixt you and me
</p>
<p class="line">Division was made by Adam.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Another rule of importance in house-building is that which regulates the length of
the threshold, as to which the instructions are as follows:—
</p>
<p>“Measure off (on a piece of string) the stretch (fathom) of the arms of her who is
to be mistress of the proposed house. Fold this string in three and cut off one third.
Take the remainder, fold it in eight and cut off seven-eighths. Take the remaining
eighth, see how many times it is contained in the length of the threshold, and check
off the number (of these measurements) against the “category” (<i lang="ms">bilangan</i>) of the “eight beasts”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7798src" href="#xd32e7798">64</a> (<i lang="ms">bĕnatang yang d’lapan</i>). This category runs as follows:—(1) The dragon (<i lang="ms">naga</i>); (2) the dairy-cow (<i lang="ms">sapi</i>); (3) the lion (<i lang="ms">singa</i>); (4) the dog (<i lang="ms">anjing</i>); (5) the draught-cow (<i lang="ms">lĕmbu</i>); (6) the ass (<i lang="ms">kaldei</i>); (7) the elephant (<i lang="ms">gajah</i>), and (8) the crow (<i lang="ms">gagak</i>), all of which have certain ominous significations. <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>If the last measurement coincides with one of the unlucky beasts in the category,
such as the crow (which signifies the death of the master of the house), the threshold
is cut shorter to make it fit in with one that is more auspicious.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7836src" href="#xd32e7836">65</a>
</p>
<p>The names of the “eight beasts,” coupled with the events which they are supposed to
foreshadow, are often commemorated in rhyming stanzas.
</p>
<p>Here is a specimen:—
</p>
<p>I.—<i>The Dragon</i> (<span lang="ms">naga</span>).

<div class="lgouter">

</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“There is the smoke of a fire in the forest,

</div>
<p class="first">In close connection with the ceremonies for the selection of individual house sites
are the forms by which the princes of Malay tradition selected sites for the towns
which they founded. The following extract will perhaps convey some idea of their character:—
</p>
<p>“One day Raja Marong Maha Podisat went into his outer audience hall, where all his
ministers, warriors, and officers were in attendance, and commanded the four <i lang="ms">Mantris</i> to equip an expedition with all the necessary officers and armed men, and with horses
and elephants, arms and accoutrements. The four <i lang="ms">Mantris</i> did as they were ordered, and when <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>all was ready they informed the Raja. The latter waited for a lucky day and an auspicious
moment, and then desired his second son to set out. The Prince took leave after saluting
his father and mother, and all the ministers, officers, and warriors who followed
him performed obeisance before the Raja. They then set out in search of a place of
settlement, directing their course between south and east, intending to select a place
with good soil, and there to build a town with fort, moat, palace, and <i lang="ms">balei</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7965src" href="#xd32e7965">67</a> They amused themselves in every forest, wood, and thicket through which they passed,
crossing numbers of hills and mountains, and stopping here and there to hunt wild
beasts, or to fish if they happened to fall in with a pool or lake.
</p>
<p>“After they had pursued their quest for some time they came to the tributary of a
large river which flowed down to the sea. Farther on they came to a large sheet of
water, in the midst of which were four islands. The Prince was much pleased with the
appearance of the islands, and straightway took a silver arrow and fitted it to his
bow named <i lang="ms">Indra Sakti</i>, and said: ‘O arrow of the bow <i lang="ms">Indra Sakti</i>, fall thou on good soil in this group of islands; wherever thou mayest chance to
fall, there will I make a palace in which to live.’ He then drew his bow and discharged
the arrow, which flew upwards with the rapidity of lightning, and with a humming sound
like that made by a beetle as it flies round a flower, and went out of sight. Presently
it came in sight again, and fell upon one of the islands, which on that account was
called <i lang="ms">Pulau Indra Sakti</i>. On that spot was erected a town with fort, palace, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span><i lang="ms">balei</i>, and all the people who were living scattered about in the vicinity were collected
together and set to work on the various buildings.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7983src" href="#xd32e7983">68</a>
</p>
<p>Even in the making of roads through the forest it would appear that sacrificial ceremonies
are not invariably neglected. On one occasion I came upon a party of Malays in the
Labu jungle who were engaged in making a bridle-track for the Selangor Government.
A small bamboo censer, on which incense had been burning, had been erected in the
middle of the trace; and I was informed that the necessary rites (for exorcising the
demons from the trace) had just been successfully concluded.

in Malay folklore with human or (occasionally) superhuman powers.

<p>In the pages which now follow I shall deal with the folklore which refers to the more

<h5 class="main"><i>The Elephant</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the Elephant we read:—
</p>
<p>“The superstitious dread entertained by Malays for the larger animals is the result
of ideas regarding <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>them which have been inherited from the primitive tribes of Eastern Asia. Muhammadanism
has not been able to stamp out the deep-rooted feelings which prompted the savage
to invest the wild beasts which he dreaded with the character of malignant deities.
The tiger, elephant, and rhinoceros<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8009src" href="#xd32e8009">69</a> were not mere brutes to be attacked and destroyed. The immense advantages which their
strength and bulk gave them over the feebly-armed savage of the most primitive tribes
naturally suggested the possession of supernatural powers; and propitiation, not force,
was the system by which it was hoped to repel them. The Malay addresses the tiger
as <i lang="ms">Datoh</i> (grandfather), and believes that many tigers are inhabited by human souls. Though
he reduces the elephant to subjection, and uses him as a beast of burden, it is universally
believed that the observance of particular ceremonies, and the repetition of prescribed
formulas, are necessary before wild elephants can be entrapped and tamed. Some of
these spells and charms (<i lang="ms">mantra</i>) are supposed to have extraordinary potency, and I have in my possession a curious
collection of them, regarding which, it was told me seriously by a Malay, that in
consequence of their being read aloud in his house three times all the hens stopped
laying! The spells in this collection are nearly all in the Siamese language, and
there is reason to believe that the modern Malays owe most of their ideas on the subject
of taming and driving elephants to the Siamese. Those, however, who had no idea of
making use of the elephant, but <span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>who feared him as an enemy, were doubtless the first to devise the idea of influencing
him by invocations. This idea is inherited, both by Malays and Siamese, from common
ancestry.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8031src" href="#xd32e8031">70</a>
</p>
<p>To the above evidence (which was collected by Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell no doubt mainly in
Perak) I would add that at Labu, in Selangor, I heard on more than one occasion a
story in which the elephant-folk were described as possessing, on the borders of Siam,
a city of their own, where they live in houses like human beings, and wear their natural
human shape. This story, which was first told me by Ungku Said Kĕchil of Jĕlĕbu, was
taken down by me at the time, and ran as follows:—
</p>
<p>“A Malay named Laboh went out one day to his rice-field and found that elephants had
been destroying his rice.
</p>
<p>“He therefore planted caltrops of a cubit and a half in length in the tracks of the
offenders. That night an elephant was wounded in the foot by one of the caltrops,
and went off bellowing with pain.
</p>
<p>“Day broke and Laboh set off on the track of the wounded elephant, but lost his way,
and after three days and nights journeying, found himself on the borders of a new
and strange country. Presently he encountered an old man, to whom he remarked ‘Hullo,
grandfather, your country is extraordinarily quiet!’ The old man replied, ‘Yes, for
all noise is forbidden, because the king’s daughter is ill.’ ‘What is the matter with
her?’ asked Si Laboh. The old man replied that she had trodden upon a caltrop. Si
Laboh then asked, ‘May I see if I can do anything to help her?’
<span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The old man then went and reported the matter to the king, who ordered Si Laboh to
be brought into his presence.
</p>
<p>“[Now the country which Si Laboh had reached was a fine open country on the borders
of Siam. It is called ‘Pak Hĕnang,’ and its only inhabitants are the elephant-people
who live there in human guise. And whoever trespasses over the boundaries of that
country turns into an elephant.]
</p>
<p>“Then Si Laboh saw that the king’s daughter, whose name was Princess Rimbut, was suffering
from one of the caltrops which he himself had planted. He therefore extracted it from
her foot, so that she recovered, and the king, in order to reward Si Laboh, gave him
the Princess in marriage.
</p>
<p>“Now when they had been married a long time, and had got two children, Si Laboh endeavoured
to persuade his wife to accompany him on a visit to his own country. To this the Princess
replied ‘Yes; but if I go you must promise never to add to the dish any young tree-shoots
at meal-time.’<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8048src" href="#xd32e8048">71</a>
</p>
<p>“On this they started, and at the end of the first day’s journey they halted and sat
down to eat. But Si Laboh had forgotten the injunctions of his wife, and put young
tree-shoots into the dish with his rice. Then his wife protested and said, ‘Did I
not tell you not to put young tree-shoots into your food?’ But Si Laboh was obstinate,
and merely replied, ‘What do I care?’ so that his wife was turned back into an elephant
and ran off into the jungle. Then Si Laboh wept and followed her, but she refused
to return as she had now become an elephant. Yet he followed her for a whole day,
but <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>she would not return to him, and he then returned homewards with his children.
</p>
<p>“This is all that is known about the origin of elephants who are human beings.”
</p>
<p>A Malay charm which was given me (at Labu) to serve as a protection against elephants
(<i lang="ms">pĕndinding gajah</i>) gives the actual name of the Elephant King—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O Grandfather Moyang Kaban,
</p>
<p class="line">Destroy not your own grandchildren.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Ghost elephants (<i lang="ms">gajah kramat</i>) are not uncommon. They are popularly believed to be harmless, but invulnerable,
and are generally supposed to exhibit some outward and visible sign of their sanctity,
such as a stunted tusk or a shrunken foot. They are the tutelary genii of certain
localities, and when they are killed the good fortune of the neighbourhood is supposed
to depart too. Certain it is, that when one of these ghost elephants was shot at Klang
a year or two ago, it did not succumb until some fifty or sixty rifle-bullets had
been poured into it, and its death was followed by a fall in the local value of coffee
and coffee land, from which the district took long to recover.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8070src" href="#xd32e8070">72</a>
</p>
<p>A ghost elephant is very often thought to be the guardian spirit of some particular
shrine—an idea that is common throughout the Peninsula.
</p>
<p>Other general ideas about the elephant are as follows:—
</p>
<p>“Elephants are said to be very frightened if they see a tree stump that has been felled
at a great height <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>from the ground, as some trees which have high spreading buttresses are cut, because
they think that giants must have felled it, and as ordinary-sized men are more than
a match for them they are in great dread of being caught by creatures many times more
powerful than their masters. Some of the larger insects of the grasshopper kind are
supposed to be objects of terror to elephants, while the particularly harmless little
pangolin (<i lang="la">Manis pentadactyla</i>) is thought to be able to kill one of these huge beasts by biting its foot. The pangolin,
by the bye, is quite toothless. Another method in which the pangolin attacks and kills
elephants is by coiling itself tightly around the end of the elephant’s trunk, and
so suffocating it. This idea is also believed in by the Singhalese, according to Mr.
W.&nbsp;T. Hornaday’s <i>Two Years in the Jungle</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8084src" href="#xd32e8084">73</a>
</p>
<p>The foregoing passage refers to Perak, but similar ideas are common in Selangor, and
they occur no doubt, with local variations, in every one of the Malay States. Selangor
Malays tell of the scaring of elephants by the process of drawing the slender stem
of the bamboo down to the ground and cutting off the top of it, when it springs back
to its place.
</p>
<p>The story of the “pangolin” is also told in Selangor with additional details. Thus
it is said that the “Jawi-jawi” tree (a kind of banyan) is always avoided by elephants
because it was once licked by the armadillo. The latter, after licking it, went his
way, and “the elephant coming up was greatly taken aback by the offensive odour, and
swore that he would never go near the tree again. He kept his oath, and his example
has been followed by his descendants, so that <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>to this day the ‘Jawi-jawi’ is the one tree in the forest which the elephant is afraid
to approach.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8093src" href="#xd32e8093">74</a>
</p>
<p>The following directions for hunting the elephant were given me by Lĕbai Jamal, a
famous elephant hunter of Lingging, near the Sungei Ujong border:—
</p>
<p>“When you first meet with the spoor of elephant or rhinoceros, observe whether the
foot-hole contains any dead wood, (then) take the twig of dead wood, together with
a ball of earth as big as a maize-cob taken from the same foot-hole (if there is only
one of you, one ball will do, if there are three of you, three balls will be wanted,
if seven, seven balls, but not more). Then roll up your ball of earth and the twig
together in a tree-leaf, breathe upon it, and recite the charm (for blinding the elephant’s
eyes), the purport of which is that if the quarry sees, its eyesight shall be destroyed,
and if it looks, its eyesight shall be dimmed, by the help of God, the prophet, and
the medicine-man, who taught the charm.
</p>
<p>“Now slip your ball of earth into your waistband just over the navel, and destroy
the scent of your body and your gun. To do this, take a bunch of certain leaves<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8102src" href="#xd32e8102">75</a> (<i lang="ms">daun sa-chĕrek</i>), together with stem-leaves of the betel-vine (<i lang="ms">kĕrapak sirih</i>), leaves of the wild camphor (<i lang="ms">chapa</i>), and leaves of the club-gourd (<i lang="ms">labu ayer puteh</i>), break their midribs with your left hand, shut your eyes, and say ‘As these tree
leaves smell, so may my body (and gun) be scented.’
</p>
<p>“When the animal is dead, beat it with an end of black cloth, repeating the charm
for driving away the <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>‘mischief’ (<i lang="ms">badi</i>) from the carcase, which charm runs as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Badiyu, Mother of Mischief, Badi Panji, Blind Mother,
</p>
<p class="line">I know the origin from which you sprang,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8142src" href="#xd32e8142">76</a>
</p>
<p class="line">Three drops of Adam’s blood were the origin from which you sprang,
</p>
<p class="line">Mischief of Earth, return to Earth,

</div>
<p class="first">The perquisites of the Pawang (magician) are to be “a little black cloth and a little
white cloth,” and the only special taboo mentioned by Lĕbai Jamal was “on no account
to let the naked skin rub against the skin of the slain animal.”
</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject of elephants, I may add that Raja Jaʿfar (of Beranang in
Selangor) told me that Lĕbai Jamal, when charged by an elephant or rhinoceros, would
draw upon the ground with his finger a line which the infuriated animal was never
able to cross. This line, he said, was called the Baris Laksamana, or the “Admiral’s
Line,” and the knowledge of how to draw it was naturally looked upon as a great acquisition.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span></p>

<div class="div4 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><i>The Tiger</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The Tiger is sometimes believed to be a man or demon in the form of a wild beast,
and to the numerous aboriginal superstitions which attach to this dreaded animal Muhammadanism
has added the notion which connects the Tiger with the Khalif Ali. One of Ali’s titles
throughout the Moslem world is ‘the Victorious Lion of the Lord,’ and in Asiatic countries,
where the lion is unknown, the <i>tiger</i> generally takes the place of the ‘king of beasts.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8185src" href="#xd32e8185">78</a>
</p>
<p>But the anthropomorphic ideas of the Malays about the Tiger go yet farther than this.
Far away in the jungle (as I have several times been told in Selangor) the tiger-folk
(no less than the elephants) have a town of their own, where they live in houses,
and act in every respect like human beings. In the town referred to their house-posts
are made of the heart of the Tree-nettle (<i lang="ms">t’ras jĕlatang</i>), and their roofs thatched with human hair—one informant added that men’s bones were
their only rafters, and men’s skins their house walls—and there they live quietly
enough until one of their periodical attacks of fierceness (<i lang="ms">mĕngganas</i>) comes on and causes them to break bounds and range the forest for their chosen prey.
</p>
<p>There are several of these tiger-villages or “enclosures” in the Peninsula, the chief
of them being Gunong Ledang (the Mount Ophir of Malacca), just as Pasummah is the
chief of such localities in Sumatra.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8201src" href="#xd32e8201">79</a> So too, from Perak, Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell writes in 1881:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>“A mischievous tiger is said sometimes to have broken loose from its pen or fold (<i lang="ms">pĕchah kandang</i>). This is in allusion to an extraordinary belief that, in parts of the Peninsula,
there are regular enclosures where tigers possessed by human souls live in association.
During the day they roam where they please, but return to the <i lang="ms">kandang</i> at night.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8215src" href="#xd32e8215">80</a>
</p>
<p>Various fables ascribe to the tiger a human origin. One of these, taken down by me
word for word from a Selangor Malay, is intended to account for the tiger’s stripes.
The gist of it ran as follows:—
</p>
<p>“An old man picked up a boy in the jungle with a white skin, green eyes, and very
long nails. Taking the boy home his rescuer named him Muhammad Yatim (<i>i.e.</i> ‘Muhammad the fatherless’), and when he grew up sent him to school, where he behaved
with great cruelty to his schoolfellows, and was therefore soundly beaten by his master
(’Toh Saih Panjang Janggut, <i>i.e.</i> ’Toh Saih Long-beard), who used a stick made of a <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>kind of wood called <i lang="ms">los</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8271src" href="#xd32e8271">81</a> to effect the chastisement. At the first cut the boy leapt as far as the doorway;
at the second he leapt to the ground, at the third he bounded into the grass, at the
fourth he uttered a growl, and at the fifth his tail fell down behind him and he went
upon all fours, whereat his master (improvising a name to curse him by), exclaimed,
‘This is of a truth God’s tiger! (<i lang="ms">Harimau Allah</i>). Go you,’ he added, addressing the tiger, ‘to the place where you will catch your
prey—the borderland between the primeval forest and the secondary forest-growth, and
that between the secondary forest-growth and the plain—catch there whomsoever you
will, but see that you catch only the headless. Alter no jot of what I say, or you
shall be consumed by the Iron of the Regalia, and crushed by the sanctity of the thirty
divisions of the Korān.’ ” Hence the tiger is to this day compelled to “ask for” his
prey, and uses divination (<i lang="ms">bĕrtĕnung</i>), as all men know, for the purpose of discovering whether his petition has yet been
granted.
</p>
<p>Hence, too, he carries on his hide to this very day the mark of the stripes with which
he was beaten at school.
</p>
<p>The method of divination said to be practised by the tiger is as follows: The tiger
lies down and gazes (<i lang="ms">bĕrtĕnung</i>) at leaves which he takes between his paws, and whenever he sees the outline of a
leaf take the <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>shape of one of his intended victims, <i>without the head</i>, he knows it to be the sign that that victim has been “granted” to him, in accordance
with the very terms of his master’s curse.
</p>
<p>I once asked (at Labu) how it was known that the tiger used divination, and was told
this story of a man who had seen it:—
</p>
<p>“A certain Malay had been working, together with his newly-married wife, in the rice-fields
at Labu, and on his stepping aside at noon into the cool of the forest, he saw a tiger
lying down among the underwood apparently gazing at something between its paws. By
creeping stealthily nearer he was able at length to discern the object at which the
tiger was gazing, and it proved to be, to his intense horror, a leaf which presented
the lineaments of his wife, lacking only the head. Hurrying back to the rice-field
he at once warned the neighbours of what he had seen, and implored them to set his
wife in their midst and escort her homeward. To this they consented, but yet, in spite
of every precaution, the tiger broke through the midst of them and killed the woman
before it could be driven off. The bereaved husband thereupon requested them to leave
him alone with the body and depart, and when they had done so, he took the body in
his arms, and so lay down embracing it, with a dagger in either hand. Before sunset
the tiger returned to its kill, and leapt upon the corpse, whereupon the husband stabbed
it to the heart, so that the points of the daggers met, and killed it on the spot.”
</p>
<p>The power of becoming a man- or were-tiger (as it has sometimes been called), is supposed
to be confined to one tribe of Sumatrans, the Korinchi Malays, many of whom are to
be met with in the Malay Native States. <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>This belief is very strongly held, and on one occasion, when I asked some Malays at
Jugra how it could be proved that the man really became a tiger, they told me the
case of a man some of whose teeth were plated with gold, and who had been accidentally
killed in the tiger stage, when the same gold plating was discovered in the tiger’s
mouth.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8313src" href="#xd32e8313">82</a>
</p>
<p>Of the strength of the Malay belief in were-tigers Mr. Clifford writes:—
</p>
<p>“The existence of the Malayan Loup Garou to the native mind is a fact, and not a mere
belief. The Malay <i>knows</i> that it is true. Evidence, if it be needed, may be had in plenty; the evidence, too,
of sober-minded men, whose words in a Court of Justice would bring conviction to the
mind of the most obstinate jurymen, and be more than sufficient to hang the most innocent
of prisoners. The Malays know well how Haji ʿAbdallah, the native of the little state
of Korinchi in Sumatra, was caught naked in a tiger trap, and thereafter purchased
his liberty at the price of the buffaloes he had slain while he marauded in the likeness
of a beast. They know of the countless Korinchi men who have vomited feathers, after
feasting upon fowls, when for the nonce they had assumed the forms of tigers; and
of those other men of the same race who have left their garments and their trading
packs in thickets whence presently a tiger has emerged. All these things the Malays
know have happened, and are <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>happening to-day, in the land in which they live, and with these plain evidences before
their eyes, the empty assurances of the enlightened European that Were-Tigers do not,
and never did exist, excite derision not unmingled with contempt.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8329src" href="#xd32e8329">83</a>
</p>
<p>Writing on the same theme, Sir Frank Swettenham says:—
</p>
<p>“Another article of almost universal belief is that the people of a small State in
Sumatra called Korinchi have the power of assuming at will the form of a tiger, and
in that disguise they wreak vengeance on those they wish to injure. Not every Korinchi
man can do this, but still the gift of this strange power of metamorphosis is pretty
well confined to the people of the small Sumatran State. At night when respectable
members of society should be in bed, the Korinchi man slips down from his hut, and,
assuming the form of a tiger, goes about ‘seeking whom he may devour.’
</p>
<p>“I have heard of four Korinchi men arriving in a district of Perak, and that night
a number of fowls were taken by a tiger. The strangers left and went farther up country,
and shortly after only three of them returned and stated that a tiger had just been
killed, and they begged the local headman to bury it.
</p>
<p>“On another occasion some Korinchi men appeared and sought hospitality in a Malay
house, and there also the fowls disappeared in the night, and there were unmistakable
traces of the visit of a tiger, but the next day one of the visitors fell sick, and
shortly after vomited chicken-feathers.
</p>
<p>“It is only fair to say that the Korinchi people strenuously deny the tendencies and
the power ascribed to them, but aver that they properly belong to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>inhabitants of a district called Chenâku in the interior of the Korinchi country.
Even there, however, it is only those who are practised in the <i lang="ms">elĕmu sĕhir</i>, the occult arts, who are thus capable of transforming themselves into tigers, and
the Korinchi people profess themselves afraid to enter the Chenâku district.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8345src" href="#xd32e8345">84</a>
</p>
<p>There are many stories about ghost tigers (<i lang="ms">rimau kramat</i>), which are generally supposed to have one foot a little smaller than the others
(<i lang="ms">kaki tengkis</i>). During my stay in the Langat district I was shown on more than one occasion the
spoor of a ghost tiger. This happened once near Sepang village, on a wet and clayey
bridle-track, where the unnatural smallness of one of the feet was very conspicuous.
Such tigers are considered invulnerable, but harmless to man, and are looked upon
generally as the guardian spirits of some sacred spot. One of these sacred spots was
the shrine (<i lang="ms">kramat</i>) of ’Toh Kamarong, about two miles north of Sepang village. This shrine, it was alleged,
was guarded by a white ghost elephant and ghost tiger, who ranged the country round
but never harmed anybody. One day, however, a Chinaman from the neighbouring pepper
plantations offered at this shrine a piece of <i>pork</i>, which, however acceptable it might have been to a Chinese saint, so incensed the
orthodox guardians of this Muhammadan shrine that one of them (the ghost tiger) fell
upon the Chinaman and slew him before he could return to his house.
</p>
<p>By far the most celebrated of these ghost tigers, however, were the guardians of the
shrine at the foot of Jugra Hill, which were formerly the pets of the Princess of
Malacca (Tuan Pŭtri Gunong Ledang). <span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>Local report says that this princess left her country when it was taken by the Portuguese,
and established herself on Jugra Hill, a solitary hill on the southern portion of
the Selangor coast, which is marked on old charts as the “False Parcelar” hill.
</p>
<p>The legend which connects the name of this princess with Jugra Hill was thus told<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8368src" href="#xd32e8368">85</a> by Mr. G.&nbsp;C. Bellamy (formerly of the Selangor Civil Service).
</p>
<p>“Bukit Jugra (Jugra Hill) in its isolated position, and conspicuous as it is from
the sea, could scarcely escape being an object of veneration to the uneducated Malay
mind. The jungle which clothes its summit and sides is supposed to be full of <i lang="ms">hantus</i> (demons or ghosts), and often when talking to Malays in my bungalow in the evening
have our discussions been interrupted by the cries of the <i lang="ms">langswayer</i> (a female birth-demon) in the neighbouring jungle, or the mutterings of the <i lang="ms">bajang</i> (a familiar spirit) as he sat on the roof-tree. But the ‘Putri’ (Princess) of Gunong
Ledang holds the premier position amongst the fabulous denizens of the jungle on the
hill, and it is strange that places so far apart as Mount Ophir and Bukit Jugra should
be associated with one another in traditionary lore. The story runs that this estimable
lady, having disposed of her husband by pricking him to death with needles,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8384src" href="#xd32e8384">86</a> decided thenceforth to live free from the restrictions of married life. She was thus
able to visit distant lands, taking with her a cat<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8389src" href="#xd32e8389">87</a> of fabulous dimensions as her sole attendant. This cat appears to have been a most
amiable and accommodating creature, for on arriving at Jugra he carried the Princess
on <span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>his back to the top of the hill. Here the lady remained for some time, and during
her stay constructed a bathing-place for herself. Even to this day she pays periodical
visits to Jugra Hill, and although she herself is invisible to mortal eye, her faithful
attendant, in the shape of a handsome tiger, is often to be met with as he prowls
about the place at night. He has never been known to injure any one, and is reverently
spoken of as a <i lang="ms">rimau kramat</i> (ghost tiger).”
</p>
<p>To the above story Mr. C.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;A. Turney (then Senior District Officer and stationed
at Jugra) added the following:—
</p>
<p>“The Princess and the stories about her and the tiger are well known, and the latter
are related from mother to daughter in Langat.
</p>
<p>“There are, however, they say, one or two omissions; instead of one tiger there were
two, the real <i lang="ms">harimau kramat</i> and an ambitious young tiger who would also follow the Princess in her round of visits.
This brute came to an untimely and ignominious end (as he deserved to) at the hands
of one Innes, who was disturbed whilst reading a newspaper, and this can be verified
by Captain Syers.
</p>
<p>“The other tiger jogged along gaily with his phantom mistress, and made night hideous
with his howlings and prowlings all about the Jugra Hill. He was really <i lang="ms">kramat</i>, and was said to have been shot at by several Malays, and the present Sergeant-Major
Allie, now stationed at Kuala Lumpur, can vouch for this.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8414src" href="#xd32e8414">88</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span></p>
<p>I myself collected at the time the following extra details:—
</p>
<p>“The local version of the legend about the <i lang="ms">kramat</i> at the foot of Jugra Hill runs somewhat as follows:—Once upon a time one Nakhoda
Ragam was travelling with his wife (who is apparently to be identified with the Princess
of Malacca, Tuan Pŭtri Gunong Ledang) in a boat (<i lang="ms">sampan</i>), when the latter pricked him to death with a needle (<i lang="ms">mati di-chuchok jarum</i>). His blood flooded the boat (<i lang="ms">darah-nya hanyut dalam sampan</i>), and presently the woman in the boat was hailed by a vessel sailing past her. ‘What
have you got in that boat?’ said the master of the vessel, and the Princess replied:
‘It is only spinach-juice’ (<i lang="ms">kuah bayam</i>). She was therefore allowed to proceed, and landed at the foot of Jugra Hill, where
she buried all that yet remained of her husband, which consisted of only one thigh
(<i lang="ms">paha</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8465src" href="#xd32e8465">89</a> She also took ashore her two cats, which were in the boat with her, and which, turning
into ghost tigers, became the guardians of this now famous shrine.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8468src" href="#xd32e8468">90</a>
</p>
<p>Tigers are naturally too fierce to be tracked by the Malays, and are usually caught
in specially constructed traps (<i lang="ms">pĕnjara rimau</i>), or killed by a self-acting <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>gun or spear-trap (<i lang="ms">b’lantek s’napang</i>, <i lang="ms">b’lantek tĕrbang</i>, <i lang="ms">b’lantek parap</i>, etc.); but even in this case the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> explains to the tiger that it was not he but Muhammad who set the trap. There are,
however, as might be expected, a great number of charms intended to protect the devotee
in various ways from the tiger’s claws and teeth. Of these I will give one or two
typical specimens.
</p>
<p>Sometimes a charm is used to keep the tiger at a distance (<i lang="ms">pĕnjauh rimau</i>):—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ho, Bĕrsĕnu! Ho, Bĕrkaih!
</p>
<p class="line">I know the origin from which you sprang;
</p>
<p class="line">(It was) Sheikh Abuniah Lahah Abu Kasap.
</p>
<p class="line">Your navel originated from the centre of your crown,
</p>
<p class="line">Your breasts are [to be seen] in [the spoor of] your fore-feet.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8509src" href="#xd32e8509">91</a>
</p>
<p class="line">May you go wide (of me) as the Seven Tiers of Heaven,
</p>
<p class="line">May you go wide (of me) as the Seven Tiers of Earth;
</p>
<p class="line">If you do not go wide,
</p>
<p class="line">You shall be a rebel unto God,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Sometimes the desired effect is expected to be obtained by a charm for locking the
tiger’s jaws:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ho, Sir Cruncher! Ho, Sir Muncher!
</p>
<p class="line">Let the twig break under the weight of the wild goose.
</p>
<p class="line">Fast shut and locked be (your jaws), by virtue of ʿAli Mustapah,
</p>
<p class="line">OM. Thus I break (the tusks of) all beasts that are tusked,
</p>
<p class="line">By virtue of this Prayer from the Land of Siam.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8525src" href="#xd32e8525">92</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span></p>
<p class="first">The next specimen is described as a “charm for fascinating” (striking fear into) a
“tiger and hardening one’s own heart”:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O Earth-Shaker, rumble and quake!
</p>
<p class="line">Let iron needles be my body-hairs,
</p>
<p class="line">Let copper needles be my body-hairs!

<p class="line">Let poisonous snakes be my beard,
</p>
<p class="line">A crocodile my tongue,
</p>
<p class="line">And a roaring tiger in the dimple of my chin.
</p>
<p class="line">Be my voice the trumpet of an elephant,
</p>
<p class="line">Yea, like unto the roar of the thunderbolt.
</p>
<p class="line">May your lips be fast closed and your teeth clenched;
</p>
<p class="line">And not till the Heavens and the Earth are moved
</p>
<p class="line">May your heart be moved
</p>
<p class="line">To be wroth with or to seek to destroy me.
</p>
<p class="line">By the virtue of ‘There is no god but God,’ ” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To which may be added—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“<i lang="ms">Kun! Payah Kun!</i>
</p>
<p class="line">Let (celestial) splendour reside in my person.
</p>
<p class="line">Whosoever talks of encountering me,

<p class="line">Endure not to confront my gaze!
</p>
<p class="line">It is I who shall confront the gaze of you,
</p>
<p class="line">By the virtue of ‘There is no god but God.’ ”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When tigers were wounded, it was said (in Selangor) that they would doctor themselves
with <i lang="ms">ubat tasak</i>, which is the name generally given to a sort of poultice used by those who have just
undergone circumcision. And when a tiger was killed a sort of public reception was
formerly always accorded to him on his return to the village.
</p>
<p>Though I have not seen the actual reception (generally miscalled a “wake”), I once
saw near Kajang in Selangor a tiger which had been prepared for the ceremony. The
animal was propped up on all fours as if alive, and his mouth kept open by propping
<span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>the roof with a stick. It was unfortunately impossible for me to wait for the ceremony,
but from a description which I received afterwards, it was evidently regarded as a
sort of “reception” given by the people of the village to a live and powerful war-chief
or champion (<i lang="ms">hulubalang</i>) who had come to pay them a visit, the dancing and fencing which takes place on such
occasions being intended for his entertainment.
</p>
<p>One of these ceremonies, which took place in Jugra in Selangor, was thus described:—
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div4 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><i>A Tiger’s Wake</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“At 10 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> a great noise of rejoicing, with drums and gongs, approaching Jugra by the river,
was heard, and on my questioning the people, I was told Raja Yakob had managed to
shoot a tiger with a spring gun behind Jugra Hill, and was bringing it in state to
the Sultan. I went over to the Sultan’s at Raja Yakob’s request to see the attendants
on the slaughter of a tiger. The animal was supported by posts and fastened in an
attitude as nearly as possible approaching the living. Its mouth was forced open,
its tongue allowed to drop on one side, and a small rattan attached to its upper jaw
was passed over a pole held by a man behind. This finished, two swords were produced
and placed crosswise, and a couple of Panglimas<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8614src" href="#xd32e8614">93</a> selected for the dance; the gongs and drums were beaten at a quick time, the man
holding the rattan attached to the tiger’s head pulled it, moving the head up and
down, and the two Panglimas, after making their obeisance to the Sultan, rushed at
their swords, and holding them in their hands commenced a most wild and exciting dance.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>They spun around on one leg, waving their swords, then bounded forward and made a
thrust at the tiger, moving back quickly with the point of the weapon facing the animal;
they crawled along the ground and sprung over it uttering defiant yells, they cut
and parried at supposed attacks, finally throwing down their weapons and taunting
the dead beast by dancing before it unarmed. This done, Inas told me the carcase was
at my disposal.
</p>
<p>“The death of the tiger now establishes the fact of the existence of tigers here,
for asserting which I have been pretty frequently laughed at. However this is not
the Jugra pest, a brute whose death would be matter for general rejoicing, the one
now destroyed being a tigress 8 feet long and 2 feet 8 inches high.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8621src" href="#xd32e8621">94</a>
</p>
<p>I may add that both the claws and whiskers of tigers are greatly sought after as charms,
and are almost invariably stolen from a tiger when one is killed by a European. I
have also seen at Klang a charm written on tiger’s skin.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div4 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><i>The Deer</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8631src" href="#xd32e8631">95</a></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Anthropomorphic ideas are held by the Malays almost as strongly in the case of the
Deer as of any other animal.
</p>
<p>The Deer is, by all Malays, believed to have sprung from a man who suffered from a
severe ulcer or abscess (<i lang="ms">chabuk</i>) on the leg, (which is supposed to have left its <span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>trace on the deer’s legs to this day). Of the Perak form of this legend Sir William
Maxwell writes as follows:—
</p>
<p>“The deer (<i lang="ms">rusa</i>) is sometimes believed to be the metamorphosed body of a man who has died of an abscess
in the leg (<i lang="ms">chabuk</i>), because it has marks on the legs which are supposed to resemble those caused by
the disease mentioned. Of course there are not wanting men ready to declare that the
body of a man who has died of <i lang="ms">chabuk</i> has been seen to rise from the grave and to go away into the forest in the shape
of a deer.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8678src" href="#xd32e8678">96</a>
</p>
<p>The Selangor legend is practically identical with that current in Perak.
</p>
<p>The deer are frequently addressed, in the charms used by the hunters, exactly as if
they were human beings, <i>e.g.</i>—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“If you wish to wear bracelets and rings
</p>
<p class="line">Stretch out your two fore-feet.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">These rings and bracelets are of course the nooses which depend from the toils.
</p>
<p>In a charm of similar import we find:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ho, Crown Prince (Raja Muda) with your Speckled Princess (Pŭtri Dandi),
</p>
<p class="line">Rouse you quickly (from your slumbers)
</p>
<p class="line">And clasp (round your neck) King Solomon’s necklace.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">I may add that in some places the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> (magician) will himself first enter the toils, probably with the object of deceiving
the stag as to their nature and purpose.
</p>
<p>The ceremonies for hunting deer are somewhat <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>intricate, and it will perhaps be best to commence by giving a general description
of deer-catching as practised by the Malays.
</p>
<p>“This pastime”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8710src" href="#xd32e8710">97</a> (deer-catching) “is one the Malay delights in. After a rainy night, deer may be easily
traced to their lair by their footprints, and as they remain stationary by day the
hunters have ample time to arrange their apparatus. When the hiding-place is discovered
all the young men of the <i lang="ms">kampong</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8718src" href="#xd32e8718">98</a> assemble, and the following ceremony is performed before they sally out on the expedition:
Six or eight coils of rattan rope, about an inch in diameter, are placed on a triangle
formed with three rice-pounders, and the oldest of the company, usually an experienced
sportsman, places a cocoa-nut shell filled with burning incense in the centre, and
taking sprigs of three bushes, viz. the <i lang="ms">jellatang</i>, <i lang="ms">sapunie</i>, and <i lang="ms">sambon</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8730src" href="#xd32e8730">99</a> plants (these, it is supposed, possess extraordinary virtues), he walks mysteriously
round the coils, beating them with the sprigs, and erewhile muttering some gibberish,
which, if possessing any meaning, the sage keeps wisely to himself. During the ceremony
the youths of the village look on with becoming gravity and admiration. It is believed
that the absence of this ceremony would render the expedition unsuccessful, the deer
would prove too strong for the ropes, and the wood demons frustrate their sport by
placing insurmountable obstacles in their way. Much faith appears to be placed in
the ceremony. Each coil referred to above is sixty to seventy fathoms long, and to
the rope running nooses, made also of rattan rope, are attached about three feet <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>apart from each other. On reaching the thicket wherein the deer are concealed, stakes
are driven into the ground a few feet apart in a straight line, the coils are then
opened out, and the rope attached to the stakes, two or three feet above the ground,
with the nooses hanging down, and two of the party conceal themselves near the stakes
armed with knives for the purpose of despatching the deer when entangled in the nooses.
The remainder of the hunters arrange themselves on the opposite side of the thicket
and advance towards it, shouting and yelling at the top of their voices. The deer,
startled from their rest, spring to their feet and naturally flee from the noise towards
the nooses, and in a short time are entangled in them. As they struggle to escape,
the concealed hunters rush out and despatch them. Occasionally the flight is prolonged
till the major party arrives, and then the noble creatures soon fall beneath the spears
and knives of their assailants. The animal is divided between the sportsmen.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8743src" href="#xd32e8743">100</a>
</p>
<p>The “gibberish” employed by the deer <i lang="ms">Pawangs</i> when the latter enter the jungle is intended to induce the wood demons and earth
demons to recede, or at least to dissuade them from active interference with the proceedings.
Charms are also employed by the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, as he proceeds, from time to time, to “ask for” a tree (to which the toils may be
fastened); to “ask for” a deer; to unroll and suspend the toils; to call upon the
spirits (who are the herdsmen of the deer) to drive the latter down to meet the dogs;
to turn back the deer when they have got away; to <span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>“prick” or urge on the dogs, or make them bark; to stop wild dogs from barking in
the jungle, or those of the pack from barking at the wrong moment; to deceive the
deer as to the reality of the toils used by the hunters; to deceive the spirits as
to the identity of the hunting-party; and, finally, to drive out the “mischief” (<i lang="ms">badi</i>) from the carcase of the slain animal; examples of all of which will be found in
the course of the next few pages.
</p>
<p>The first charm which I give is one used in “asking for deer”:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</p>
<p>A deer <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> named ’Che Indut gave me a charm <span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>for turning the deer back upon their tracks, “though their flesh was torn to rags
and their bones well-becudgelled.” It concluded with the following appeal to the spirits:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ho (ye Spirits) turn back my Deer!
</p>
<p class="line">If you do not turn them back,
</p>
<p class="line">At sea ye shall get no drink,
</p>
<p class="line">Ashore ye shall find no food.
</p>
<p class="line">By virtue of the word of God,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">I will conclude with the following charm, believed to be a means of bringing the stag
low:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Measure off three sticks (probably dead wood taken from the slot of the deer, as
in the case of the elephant), their length being measured by the distance from the
roof of your mouth to the teeth of the lower jaw. Lay these sticks in a triangular
form inside the slot of the stag, press the left thumb downwards in the centre of
the triangle, and humble your heart. This will humble the deer’s heart too.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The Mouse-deer or chevrotin is the “Brer Rabbit” of the Malays. It figures in many
proverbial sayings and romances, in which it is credited with extraordinary sagacity,
and is honoured by the title of “Mĕntri B’lukar,” the “Vizier of the (secondary) Forest-Growth.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9151src" href="#xd32e9151">110</a>
</p>
<p>It is generally taken by means of a snare called <i lang="ms">tapah pĕlandok</i>, but sometimes by tapping on the ground with sticks (<i lang="ms">mĕngĕtok pĕlandok</i>), the sound of which is supposed to imitate the drumming of the buck’s fore-feet
upon the ground in rutting-time, by which the attention of the doe is attracted. Whatever
the reason may be, there is no doubt that the method is often successful.
</p>
<p>When this “tapping” method is adopted, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>charms used are similar to those used for calling the big deer, <i>e.g.</i>—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="ms" class="lg xd32e2490">
<p class="line">“Arak-arak iring-iring
</p>
<p class="line">Kĕmbang bunga si Panggil-Panggil,
</p>
<p class="line">Datang bĕrarak, datang bĕriring,
</p>
<p class="line">Raja Suleiman datang mĕmanggil.
</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Follow in procession, follow in succession,
</p>
<p class="line">The Assembly-flower has opened its petals.
</p>
<p class="line">Come in procession, come in succession,
</p>
<p class="line">King Solomon comes to summon you.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">But at the end of the charm is added, “<i lang="ms">Ini-lah gong-nya</i>,” <i>i.e.</i> “This is his (King Solomon’s) gong.”
</p>
<p>The stick which is used may be of any kind of wood except a creeper, and the best
place for the operation is where the ground sounds hollow when tapped. Either three,
five, or seven leaves must, however, be laid on the spot before the tapping is commenced.
</p>
<p>The directions for setting the snare (<i lang="ms">jĕrat</i> or <i lang="ms">tapah pĕlandok</i>) were taken down by me as follows:—
</p>
<p>First look for a tree whose sap is viscid, and chop at it thrice (with a cutlass).
If the splinters fall, one the right and the other the wrong way up (lit. one prone
and the other supine), it is a bad sign (though it is a good sign when one is setting
a trap); for in the case of a snare they must fall the wrong way up (supine).
</p>
<p>When this is done, commence to set the snare near the foot of a tree, at about a fathom’s
distance, and say:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“As a cocoa-nut shell rocks to and fro
</p>
<p class="line">When filled with clay,
</p>
<p class="line">Avaunt ye, Jĕmbalang and Badi,
</p>
<p class="line">That I may set this snare.”</p>

<h5 class="main"><i>Hunting-Dogs</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hunting-dogs are spoken to continually as if they were human beings. Several examples
of this occur in the deer charms.
</p>
<p>Thus we find the following passage addressed to the dogs:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Let not go the scent,
</p>
<p class="line">Formidable were you from the first;
<hr class="tb">
</p>
<p class="line">Hot-foot, hot-foot, do you pursue,
</p>
<p class="line">If you do not pursue hot-foot,
</p>
<p class="line">I will minimise my benediction (lit. my ‘Peace be with you’).
</p>
<p class="line">If it (the deer) be a buck, you shall have him for a brother;
</p>
<p class="line">If it be a doe, you shall have her for a wife.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So too, again, after calling several dogs by name, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> gets together the accessories (leaves of the <i lang="ms">tukas</i> and <i lang="ms">lĕnjuang</i>, a brush of leaves (<i lang="ms">sa-chĕrek</i>) and a black cloth), and exclaims:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Bark, Sir Slender-foot; bark, Sir Brush-tail.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> generally tries to deceive the deer as to his ownership of the hunting-dogs. Thus
he will say:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“It is not I whose dogs these are,
</p>
<p class="line">It is the magical deer <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> whose dogs these are.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So, too, they are called by certain specific names (according to their breed and colour),
which are in several cases identical with the names of the dogs with which the wild
Spectre Huntsman (the most terrible of all personified diseases in the Malay category)
hunts down his prey.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9276src" href="#xd32e9276">111</a>
</p>
<p>Ugliness is by no means looked upon as a disadvantage, but rather the opposite. An
ugly dog is apparently formidable. Thus we find a dog addressed as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Let not go the scent (of the quarry)
</p>
<p class="line">As you were formidable (lit. ugly)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9285src" href="#xd32e9285">112</a> from the first.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Again, the description of the “good points” of some of these dogs which is given in
the Appendix would, if ugliness and formidability are convertible terms, satisfy the
most exacting whipper-in, the so-called good points being for the most part a mere
list of deformities. These points, however, are merely the external sign of the Luck
to which dogs, as well as human beings, are believed to be born. In a fine passage
we are told:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“From the seven Hills and the seven Valleys
</p>
<p class="line">Comes the intense barking of my Dogs.
</p>
<p class="line">My Dogs are Dogs of Luck,
</p>
<p class="line">Not Luck that is adventitious,
</p>
<p class="line">But Luck incarnate with their bodies.
</p>
<p class="line">Go tread upon the heaped and rotting leaves,
</p>
<p class="line">And never desert the scent.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Speaking of dog-lore generally, it may be remarked that though dogs are very frequently
kept by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>Malays, it is considered unlucky to keep them. “The dog … is unlucky. He longs for
the death of his master, an event which will involve the slaying of animals at the
funeral feast, when the bones will fall to the dogs. When a dog is heard howling at
night, he is supposed to be thinking of the broken bones (<i lang="ms">niat handak mengutib tulang patah</i>).”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9310src" href="#xd32e9310">113</a>
</p>
<p>Even the wild dogs in the jungle<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9318src" href="#xd32e9318">114</a> are warned not to bark, and are addressed as if they were human:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“If you bark your windpipe shall burst,
</p>
<p class="line">If you smack your lips your tongue shall be docked.
<p class="tb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
</p>
<p class="line">If you come nearer, you shall break your leg;
<p class="tb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
</p>
<p class="line">Return to the big virgin jungle,

<h5 class="main"><i>Bears and Monkeys</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The Bear<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9363src" href="#xd32e9363">116</a> is believed to be the mortal foe of the Tiger, which he sometimes defeats in single
combat. <span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">Bruang</i>, the Malay word for ‘bear,’ has a curious resemblance to our word ‘Bruin.’<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9377src" href="#xd32e9377">117</a>) A story is told of a tame bear which a Malay left in charge of his house and of
his sleeping child while he was absent from home. On his return he missed his child,
the house was in disorder, as if some struggle had taken place, and the bear was covered
with blood. Hastily drawing the conclusion that the bear had killed and devoured the
child, the enraged father slew the animal with his spear, but almost immediately afterwards
he found the carcase of a tiger, which the faithful bear had defeated and killed,
and the child emerged unharmed from the jungle, where she had taken refuge. It is
unnecessary to point out the similarity of this story to the legend of Beth-Gelert.
It is evidently a local version of the story of the Ichneumon and the Snake in the
Pancha-tantra.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9389src" href="#xd32e9389">118</a>
</p>
<p>Monkeys and men have always been associated in native tradition, and Malay folklore
is no exception to the rule. Thus we get the tradition of the great man-like ape,
the Mawas (a reminiscence of the orang-outang or mias of Borneo), which is said to
make shelters for itself in the forks of trees, and to be born with the blade of a
cutlass (woodknife) in place of the bone of the forearm, so that it is able to cut
down the undergrowth as it walks through the jungle. It <span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>is believed, moreover, occasionally to carry off and mate with human kind.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9399src" href="#xd32e9399">119</a>
</p>
<p>The Siamang (<i lang="la">Hylobates lar</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9411src" href="#xd32e9411">120</a> which walks on its hind-legs, is, however, the species which is most commonly associated
in legend with the human race; in fact, it is not impossible that there may sometimes
have been a confusion between its name (<i lang="ms">siamang</i>) and Sĕmang, which is the name of one of the aboriginal (Negrito) races of the interior.
The following Malay legend, which I took down at Labu in Selangor is believed to explain
its origin, and also that of the Bear:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9429src" href="#xd32e9429">121</a>—
</p>
<p>Once upon a time her Highness the Princess Telan became the affianced bride of Si
Malim Bongsu. After the betrothal Si Malim Bongsu sailed away and did not return when
the period of the engagement, which was fixed at from three to four months, came to
an end.
</p>
<p>Then Si Malim Panjang, elder brother of Si Malim Bongsu, decided to take the place
of his younger brother, and be married to the Princess Telan. The latter, however,
repelled his advances, and he therefore attacked her savagely; but she <span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>turned herself into an ape (<i lang="ms">siamang</i>) and escaped to the jungle, so that Si Malim Panjang desisted from pursuit. Then
the ape climbed up into a <i lang="ms">pagar-anak</i> tree which grew on the sea-shore, and leaned over the sea, and there she chanted
these words:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O my dear Malim Bongsu,
</p>
<p class="line">You have broken your solemn promise and engagement,
</p>
<p class="line">And I have to take upon myself the form of an ape.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Now Si Malim Bongsu was passing at the time, and on recognising the voice of the Princess
Telan he took a blow-gun and shot her so that she fell into the sea. Then he took
rose-water and sprinkled it over her, so that she resumed her natural shape, and they
started to go home together. Still, however, Si Malim Bongsu would not wed her, but
promised that he would do so when he came back from his next voyage, whereupon the
Princess chanted these words:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“If you do not return within three months
</p>
<p class="line">You will find me turned into an ape.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The same course of events, however, happened as before. Malim Bongsu did not return
at the time appointed; his elder brother, Malim Panjang once more attacked her, and,
leaping towards an areca palm, she once more became an ape, whereupon she chanted
as before:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O my dear Malim Bongsu,
</p>
<p class="line">You have broken your solemn promise and engagement,
</p>
<p class="line">And I am forced to become an ape.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Again Malim Bongsu, as he passed by, heard and recognised her voice; but upon learning
that he had been for the second time the cause of his Princess’s troubles, he exclaimed,
“Better were it for me were <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>I nothing but a big fish”; and leaping into the water he disappeared, and was changed
into a big fish as he desired.
</p>
<p>Now the Princess’s nurse (who was called “The Daughter of Sakembang China”) was at
the same time transformed into a bear, and as they were bathing at the time when they
were surprised, and had not time to wash off all the soap (rice-cosmetic), the white
marks on the breast and brows of the bear and on the breast and brows of the ape (<i lang="ms">siamang</i>) have remained unto this day.
</p>
<p>Occasionally the opposite transformation is believed to take place, some species of
the monkey tribe being supposed to turn into fish.
</p>
<p>Thus the <i lang="ms">k’ra</i> (<i lang="la">Macacus cynomolgus</i>) is believed to develop into a species of fish called <i lang="ms">sĕnunggang</i>, and of the fish called <i lang="ms">kalul</i> (<i lang="ms">kalui</i> or <i lang="ms">kalue</i>), Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell writes: “The <i lang="ms">ikan kalul</i> (is believed) to be a monkey transformed. Some specially favoured observers have
seen monkeys half through the process of metamorphosis—half-monkey and half-fish.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9502src" href="#xd32e9502">122</a> The species of monkey which is believed to turn into the <i lang="ms">ikan kalul</i> is, as I was told in Selangor, the <i lang="ms">b’rok</i> or “cocoa-nut monkey.”
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Berhakim kapada brok</i>” is a Malay proverbial expression which means, “ ‘To make the monkey judge,’ or,
‘to go to the monkey for justice.’ A fable is told by the Malays of two men, one of
whom planted bananas on the land of the other. When the fruit was ripe each claimed
it, but not being able to come to any settlement they referred the matter to the arbitration
of a monkey (of the large kind called <i lang="ms">brok</i>). The judge decided that the fruit must be <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>divided; but no sooner was this done than one of the suitors complained that the other’s
share was too large. To satisfy him the monkey reduced the share of the other by the
requisite amount, which he ate himself. Then the second suitor cried out that the
share of the first was now too large. It had to be reduced to satisfy him, the subtracted
portion going to the monkey as before. Thus they went on wrangling until the whole
of the fruit was gone, and there was nothing left to wrangle about. Malay judges,
if they are not calumniated, have been known to protract proceedings until both sides
have exhausted their means in bribes. In such cases the unfortunate suitors are said
to <i lang="ms">berhakim kapada brok</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9527src" href="#xd32e9527">123</a>

<div class="div4 last-child section">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><i>The Wild Pig and Other Animals</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are several superstitions about the Wild Boar which prove that it was not always
regarded as an unclean animal.
</p>
<p>Of these the following recipe, which was given me by a Jugra (Selangor) Malay, for
turning brass into gold is the most remarkable:—
</p>
<p>“Kill a wild pig and rip open its paunch. Sew up in this a quantity of old ‘scrap’
brass, pile timber over it, burn it, and then leave it alone until the grass has grown
right over it. Then dig up the gold.” Again, certain wild boars are believed to carry
on their tushes a talisman of extraordinary power, which is called <i lang="ms">rantei babi</i>, or “Wild Boar’s Chain.” This chain consists, it is asserted, of three links of various
metals (gold, silver, and amalgam), and is hung up on a shrub by the wild boar when
he is <span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>enjoying his wallow, so that it is occasionally stolen by Malays who know his habits.
I may add that, according to a Malay at Langat, the “were-tiger” (<i lang="ms">rimau jadi-jadian</i>) occasionally appears in the shape of a wild boar escaping from a grave, in the centre
of which may be afterwards seen the hole by which the animal has escaped.
</p>
<p>“Among the modern Malays avoidance of the flesh of swine and of contact with anything
connected with the unclean animal is, of course, universal. No tenet of El-Islam is
more rigidly enforced than this. It is singular to notice, among a people governed
by the ordinances of the Prophet, traces of the observance of another form of abstinence
enjoined by a different religion. The universal preference of the flesh of the Buffalo
to that of the Ox in Malay countries is evidently a prejudice bequeathed to modern
times by a period when cow-beef was as much an abomination to Malays as it is to the
Hindus of India at the present day. This is not admitted or suspected by ordinary
Malays, who would probably have some reason, based on the relative wholesomeness of
buffalo and cow-beef, to allege in defence of their preference of the latter to the
former.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9550src" href="#xd32e9550">124</a>
</p>
<p>To the above I may add that it is invariably the flesh of the Buffalo, and not that
of the Ox, which is eaten sacrificially on the occasion of festivities.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9558src" href="#xd32e9558">125</a> But the flesh of the so-called White (albino) Buffalo (<i lang="ms">kĕrbau balar</i>) is generally avoided as food, though I have known it to be prescribed medicinally
(as in the case of Raja Kahar, a son of H.H. the Sultan of <span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>Selangor, the circumstances of whose illness will be detailed elsewhere).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9571src" href="#xd32e9571">126</a> As might be expected, a story is told by the Malays to account for this distinction.
The general outline of the tale is to the effect that a Malay boy (a mere child) fell
into the big rice-bin (<i lang="ms">kĕpok</i>) in his parents’ absence and was suffocated by the rice. After some days the body
began to decompose, and the ooze emanating from the rice-bin was licked up by a buffalo
belonging to the boy’s parents. The attention of these latter being thus attracted
to the rice-bin, they found therein the remains of their child, and thereupon cursed
the buffalo, which (we are led to infer) became “white,” and has remained so ever
since. According to one version, a ground-dove (<i lang="ms">tĕkukur</i>) was implicated both in the offence and the punishment which followed it. Wherefore
to this day no man eats of the flesh of either of the offenders.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most extraordinary transformation in which the Malays implicitly believe
is that of the Squirrel, which is supposed to be developed from a large caterpillar
called <i lang="ms">ulat sĕntadu</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9587src" href="#xd32e9587">127</a>
</p>
<p>About the Cat there are many superstitions which show that it is believed to possess
supernatural powers. Thus it is supposed to be lucky to keep cats because they long
for a soft cushion to lie upon, and so (indirectly) wish for the prosperity of their
<span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>master.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9613src" href="#xd32e9613">128</a> On the other hand, cats must be very carefully prevented from rubbing up against
a corpse, for it is said that on one occasion when this was neglected, the <i lang="ms">badi</i> or Evil Principle which resides in the cat’s body entered into the corpse, which
thus became endowed with unnatural life and stood up upon its feet. So too the soaking
of the cat in a pan of water until it is half-drowned is believed to produce an abundance
of rain.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9625src" href="#xd32e9625">129</a> It is, besides, believed to be extremely unlucky to kill cats. Of this superstition
Mr. Clifford says:—
</p>
<p>“It is a common belief among Malays that if a cat is killed he who takes its life
will in the next world be called upon to carry and pile logs of wood, as big as cocoa-nut
trees, to the number of the hairs on the beast’s body. Therefore cats are not <i>killed</i>; but if they become too daring in their raids on the hen-coop or the food rack, they
are tied to a raft and sent floating down stream, to perish miserably of hunger. The
people of the villages by which they pass make haste to push the raft out again into
mid-stream, should it in its passage adhere to bank or bathing-hut, and on no account
is the animal suffered to land. To any one who thinks about it, this long and lingering
death is infinitely more cruel than one caused by a blow from an axe; but the Malays
do not trouble to consider such a detail, and would care little if they did.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9635src" href="#xd32e9635">130</a>
</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject of cats, I must mention the belief that the “fresh-water
fish called <i lang="ms">ikan belidah</i>” was “originally a cat.” Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell says that many Malays refuse to eat it
for this reason, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>adds, “They declare that it squalls like a cat when harpooned, and that its bones
are very white and fine like a cat’s hairs.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9646src" href="#xd32e9646">131</a> A story is also sometimes told to account both for the general similarity of habits
of the cat and the tiger and for the fact that the latter, unlike most of the <i lang="la">Felidæ</i>, is not a tree-climber. It is to the effect that the cat agreed to teach the tiger
its tricks, which it did, with the exception of the art of climbing trees. The tiger,
thinking it had learnt all the cat’s tricks, proceeded to attack its teacher, when
the cat escaped by climbing up a tree; so the tiger never learnt how to climb and
cannot climb trees to this day.
</p>
<p>Even the smallest and commonest of mammals, such as Rats and Mice, are the objects
of many strange beliefs. Thus “clothes which have been nibbled by rats or mice must
not be worn again. They are sure to bring misfortune, and are generally given away
in charity.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9657src" href="#xd32e9657">132</a>
</p>
<p>So too on the Selangor coast a mollusc called <i lang="ms">siput tantarang</i> or <i lang="ms">mĕntarang</i> is believed to have sprung from a mouse; and many kinds of charms, generally addressed
to the “Prophet Joseph” (Nabi Yusuf), are resorted to in order to drive away rats
and mice from the rice-fields.
</p>
<p>The following passage describes the general ideas about animal superstitions which
prevail on the east coast of the Peninsula:—
</p>
<p>“The beliefs and superstitions of the Fisher Folk would fill many volumes. They believe
in all manner of devils and local sprites. They fear greatly the demons that preside
over animals, and will not willingly mention the names of birds or beasts while <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>at sea. Instead, they call them all <i lang="ms">chêweh</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9676src" href="#xd32e9676">133</a>—which, to them, signifies an animal, though to others it is meaningless, and is supposed
not to be <span class="sic" title="Suggested correction: understood">understanded</span> of the beasts. To this word they tack on the sound which each beast makes in order
to indicate what animal is referred to; thus the pig is the grunting <i lang="ms">chêweh</i>, the buffalo the <i lang="ms">chêweh</i> that says ‘<i lang="ms">uak</i>,’ and the snipe the <i lang="ms">chêweh</i> that cries ‘<i lang="ms">kek-kek</i>.’ Each boat that puts to sea has been <span class="sic">medicined</span> with care, many incantations and other magic observances having been had recourse
to, in obedience to the rules which the superstitious people have followed for ages.
After each take the boat is ‘swept’ by the medicine man with a tuft of leaves prepared
with mystic ceremonies, which is carried at the bow for the purpose. The omens are
watched with exact care, and if they be adverse no fishing-boat puts to sea that day.
Every act in their lives is regulated by some regard for the demons of the sea and
air, and yet these folk are nominally Muhammadans, and, according to that faith, magic
and sorcery, incantations to the spirits, and prayers to demons, are all unclean things
forbidden to the people. But the Fisher Folk, like other inhabitants of the Peninsula,
are Malays first and Muhammadans afterwards. Their religious creed goes no more than
skin deep, and affects but little the manner of their daily life.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9700src" href="#xd32e9700">134</a>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">3.</span> VEGETATION CHARMS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Vegetation Spirit of the Malays “follows in some vague and partial way,” to use
Professor Tylor’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>words, from the analogy of the Animal Spirit. It is difficult to say, without a more
searching inquiry than I have yet had the opportunity of making, whether Malay magicians
would maintain that <i>all</i> trees had souls (<i lang="ms">sĕmangat</i>) or not. All that we can be certain of at present is that a good many trees are certainly
supposed by them to have souls, such, for instance, as the Durian, the Cocoa-nut palm,
and the trees which produce Eagle-wood (<i lang="ms">gharu</i>), Gutta Percha, Camphor, and a good many others.
</p>
<p>What can be more significant than the words and actions of the men who in former days
would try and frighten the Durian groves into bearing; or of the toddy-collector who
addresses the soul of the Cocoa-nut palm in such words as, “Thus I bend your neck,
and roll up your hair; and here is my ivory toddy-knife to help the washing of your
face”;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9723src" href="#xd32e9723">135</a> or of the collectors of jungle produce who traffic in Eagle-wood, Camphor, and Gutta
(the spirits of the first two of which trees are considered extremely powerful and
dangerous) or, above all, of the reapers who carry the “Rice-soul” home at harvest
time?
</p>
<p>A special point in connection with the Malay conception of the vegetation soul perhaps
requires particular attention, viz. the fact that apparently dead and even seasoned
timber may yet retain the soul which animated it during its lifetime. Thus, the instructions
for the performance of the rites to be used at the launching of a boat (which will
be found below under the heading “The Sea, Rivers, and Streams”)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9731src" href="#xd32e9731">136</a> involve an invocation to the timbers of the boat, which would therefore seem to be
conceived as capable, to some extent, of receiving impressions and communications
<span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>made in accordance with the appropriate forms and ceremonies.
</p>
<p>So, too, a boat with a large knot in the centre of the bottom is considered good for
catching fish, and in strict conformity with this idea is the belief that the natural
excrescences (or knobs) and deformities of trees are mere external evidences of an
indwelling spirit. So, too, the fruit of the cocoa-nut palm, when the shell lacks
the three “eyes” to which we are accustomed, is believed to serve in warfare as a
most valuable protection (<i lang="ms">pĕlias</i>) against the bullets of the enemy, and the same may be said in a minor degree of
the joints of “solid” bamboo (<i lang="ms">buluh tumpat</i>) which are occasionally found, whilst to a slightly different category belong the
comparatively numerous examples of “Tabasheer” (mineral concretions in the wood of
certain trees), which are so highly valued by the Malays for talismanic purposes.
Such trees as the <i lang="ms">Mali mali</i>, <i lang="ms">Rotan jĕr’nang</i> (Dragon’s-blood rattan), <i lang="ms">Buluh kasap</i> (rough bamboo), etc., are all said to supply instances of the concretions referred
to, but the most famous of them all is without doubt the so-called “cocoa-nut pearl,”
of which I quote the following account from Dr. Denys’s <i>Descriptive Dictionary of British Malaya</i>.
</p>
<div class="div4 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><i>Cocoa-nut Pearls</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following remarks concerning these peculiar accretions are extracted from <i>Nature</i>:—
</p>
<p>“During my recent travels,” Dr. Sidney Hickson writes to a scientific contemporary,
“I was frequently asked by the Dutch planters and others if I had ever seen ‘a cocoa-nut
stone.’ These stones are said to be rarely found (1 in 2000 or more) in the perisperm
<span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>of the cocoa-nut, and when found are kept by the natives as a charm against disease
and evil spirits. This story of the cocoa-nut stone was so constantly told me, and
in every case without any variation in its details, that I made every effort before
leaving to obtain some specimens, and eventually succeeded in obtaining two.
</p>
<p>“One of these is nearly a perfect sphere, 14 mm. in diameter, and the other, rather
smaller in size, is irregularly pear-shaped. In both specimens the surface is worn
nearly smooth by friction. The spherical one I have had cut into two halves, but I
can find no concentric or other markings on the polished cut surfaces.
</p>
<p>“Dr. Kimmins has kindly submitted one-half to a careful chemical analysis, and finds
that it consists of pure carbonate of lime without any trace of other salts or vegetable
tissue.
</p>
<p>“I should be very glad if any of your readers could inform me if there are any of
these stones in any of the museums, or if there is any evidence beyond mere hearsay
of their existence in the perisperm of the cocoa-nut.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9774src" href="#xd32e9774">137</a>
</p>
<p>On this letter Mr. Thiselton Dyer makes the following remarks:—“Dr. Hickson’s account
of the calcareous concretions occasionally found in the central hollow (filled with
fluid—the so-called ‘milk’) of the endosperm of the seed of the cocoa-nut is extremely
interesting. It appears to me a phenomenon of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>same order as tabasheer, to which I recently drew attention in <i>Nature</i>.
</p>
<p>“The circumstances of the occurrence of these stones or ‘pearls’ are in many respects
parallel to those which attend the formation of tabasheer. In both cases mineral matter
in palpable masses is withdrawn from solution in considerable volumes of fluid contained
in tolerably large cavities in living plants; and in both instances they are <i lang="la">monocotyledons</i>.
</p>
<p>“In the case of the cocoa-nut pearls the material is calcium carbonate, and this is
well known to concrete in a peculiar manner from solutions in which organic matter
is also present.
</p>
<p>“In my note on tabasheer I referred to the reported occurrence of mineral concretions
in the wood of various tropical <i lang="la">dicotyledonous</i> trees. Tabasheer is too well known to be pooh-poohed; but some of my scientific friends
express a polite incredulity as to the other cases. I learn, however, from Prof. Judd,
F.R.S., that he has obtained a specimen of apatite found in cutting up a mass of teak-wood.
The occurrence of this mineral under these circumstances has long been recorded; but
I have never had the good fortune to see a specimen.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9794src" href="#xd32e9794">138</a>

<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><i>The Durian</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Durian tree (for an account of whose famous fruit the classical description in
Wallace’s <i>Malay Archipelago</i> may be referred to) is a semi-wild fruit-tree, whose stem frequently rises to the
height of some eighty or ninety feet before the branches are <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>met with. It is generally planted in groves, which are often to be found in the jungle
when all other traces of former human habitation have completely disappeared, though
even then its fruit, if tradition says true, is as keenly fought over by the denizens
of the forest (monkeys, bears, and tigers) as ever it was by their temporary dispossessors.
Interspersed among the Durian trees will be found numerous varieties of orchard trees
of a less imperial height, amongst which may be named the Rambutan,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9810src" href="#xd32e9810">139</a> Rambei,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9815src" href="#xd32e9815">140</a> Lansat,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9820src" href="#xd32e9820">141</a> Duku,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9827src" href="#xd32e9827">142</a> Mangostin,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9830src" href="#xd32e9830">143</a> and many others. A small grove of these trees, which was claimed by the late Sultan
ʿAbdul Samad of Selangor, grew within about a mile of my bungalow at Jugra, and I
was informed that in years gone by a curious ceremony (called <i lang="ms">Mĕnyemah durian</i>) was practised in order to make the trees more productive. On a specially selected
day, it was said, the village would assemble at this grove, and (no doubt with the
usual accompaniment of the burning of incense and scattering of rice) the most barren
of the Durian trees would be singled out from the rest. One of the local <i lang="ms">Pawangs</i> would then take a hatchet (<i lang="ms">bĕliong</i>) and deliver several shrewd blows upon the trunk of the tree, saying:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Will you now bear fruit or not?
</p>
<p class="line">If you do not I shall fell you.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9848src" href="#xd32e9848">144</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">To this the tree (through the mouth of a man who had <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>been stationed for the purpose in a Mangostin tree hard by) was supposed to make answer:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Yes, I will now bear fruit;
</p>
<p class="line">I beg you not to fell me.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9860src" href="#xd32e9860">145</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">I may add that it was a common practice in the fruit season for the boys who were
watching for the fruit to fall (for which purpose they were usually stationed in small
palm-thatch shelters) to send echoing through the grove a musical note, which they
produced by blowing into a bamboo instrument called <i lang="ms">tuang-tuang</i>. I cannot, however, say whether this custom now has any ceremonial significance or
not, though it seems not at all unlikely that it once had.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9869src" href="#xd32e9869">146</a>

<div class="div4 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><i>The Malacca Cane</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No less distinct are the animistic ideas of the Malays relating to various species
of the Malacca-cane plant. Mr. Wray of the Perak Museum writes as follows:—
</p>
<p>“A Malacca-cane with a joint as long as the height of the owner will protect him from
harm by snakes and animals, and will give him luck in all things. What is called a
<i lang="ms">samambu bangku</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9883src" href="#xd32e9883">147</a> or <i lang="ms">baku</i>, possesses <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>the power of killing any one even when the person is only slightly hurt by a blow
dealt with it. These are canes that have died down and have begun to shoot again from
near the root. They are very rare, one of eighteen inches in length is valued at six
or seven dollars, and one long enough to make a walking stick of, at thirty to fifty
dollars. At night the <i lang="ms">rotan samambu</i> plant is said to make a loud noise, and, according to the Malays, it says, ‘<i lang="ms">Bulam sampei, bulam sampei</i>,’<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9917src" href="#xd32e9917">148</a> meaning that it has not yet reached its full growth. They are often to be heard in
the jungle at night, but the most diligent search will not reveal their whereabouts.
The <i lang="ms">rotan manoh</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9925src" href="#xd32e9925">149</a> is also said to give out sounds at night. The sounds are loud and musical, but the
alleged will-o’-the-wisp character of the rattans which are supposed to produce them
seems to point to some night-bird, tree-frog, or lizard as being the real cause of
the weird notes, though it is just possible that the wind might make the rattan leaves
vibrate in such a way as to cause the sounds.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9931src" href="#xd32e9931">150</a>
</p>
<p>In Selangor it is the stick-insect (<i lang="ms">kĕranting</i>) which is believed to be the embodiment of the “Malacca-cane spirit” (<i lang="ms">Hantu Samambu</i>), by which last name it is most commonly called. These stick-insects are believed
by the Selangor Malays to produce the sounds to which Mr. Wray refers, and in order
to account for their peculiar character a story is told, the main features of which
are as follows:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time a married couple fell out, and the husband surreptitiously introduced
stones into the cooking-pot in place of the yams which his wife was cooking. Then
he went off to climb for a cocoa-nut, and as he climbed, he mocked her by calling
out “<i lang="ms">Masak bĕlum? Masak bĕlum?</i>” (“Are they cooked yet? Are they cooked yet?”). What she did by way of retaliation
is not clear, but as he climbed and mocked her, she is said to have retorted, “<i lang="ms">Panjat bĕlum? Panjat bĕlum?</i>” (“Have you climbed it yet? Have you climbed it yet?”), a reply which clearly shows
that her woman’s wit had been at work, and that she was not going to allow her husband
to get the better of her.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9952src" href="#xd32e9952">151</a> However this may be, a deadlock ensued, the result of which was that both parties
were transformed into stick-insects, but were yet condemned to mock each other as
they had done during the period of their human existence.
</p>
<p>I have often from my boat, during dark nights on the Langat river, listened to the
weird note which my Malays invariably ascribed to these insects, and which is not
inaptly represented by one of the Malay names for them, viz. “<i lang="ms">bĕlum-bĕlam</i>.” I have not yet, however, succeeded in identifying the real producer of the note,
of which all I can say at present is, that although it may not be itself discoverable,
the Malays look upon it as a certain guide to the localities where the Malacca-canes
grow.

<h5 class="main"><i>The Tualang or Sialang Tree</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So too of the Tualang-tree Mr. Wray writes:—
</p>
<p>“One of the largest and stateliest of the forest trees in Perak is that known as Toallong,
or Toh Allong;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9976src" href="#xd32e9976">152</a> it has a very poisonous sap, which produces great irritation when it comes in contact
with the skin. Two Chinamen who had felled one of these trees in ignorance, had their
faces so swelled and inflamed that they could not see out of their eyes, and had to
be led about for some days before they recovered from the effects of the poison. Their
arms, breasts, and faces were affected, and they presented the appearance of having
a very bad attack of erysipelas. These trees are supposed to be the abiding-places
of <i lang="ms">hantu</i>, or spirits, when they have large hollow projections from the trunk, called <i lang="ms">rumah hantu</i>, or spirit houses. These projections are formed when a branch gets broken off near
the trunk, and are quite characteristic of the tree. There are sometimes three or
four of them on a large tree, and the Malays have a great objection to cutting down
any that are so disfigured, the belief being that if a man fells one he will die within
the year. As a rule these trees are left standing when clearings are made, and they
are a source of trouble and expense to planters and others, who object to their being
left uncut.
</p>
<p>“The following series of events actually happened:—A Malay named Panda Tambong undertook,
against the advice of his friends, to fell one of the Toh Allong trees, and he almost
immediately afterwards was taken ill with fever, and died in a few weeks’ time. Shortly
<span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>after this some men were sitting plaiting <i lang="ms">ataps</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9991src" href="#xd32e9991">153</a> under the shade of another of these ill-omened trees, when, without any warning,
a large branch fell down, breaking the arm of one man, and more or less injuring two
others. There was not a breath of wind at the time, or anything else likely to determine
the fall of the branch. After this it was decided to have the tree felled, as there
were coolie houses nearly under it. There was great difficulty in getting any one
to fell it. Eventually a Penang Malay undertook the job, but stipulated that a <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, or sorcerer, should be employed to drive away the demons first. The Pawang hung
pieces of white and red cloth on sticks round the tree, burnt incense in the little
contrivances made of the split leaf-stalks of the <i lang="ms">bĕrtam</i> palm, used by the Malays for that purpose, cut off the heads of two white fowls,
sprinkled the blood over the trunk, and in the midst of many incantations the tree
was felled without any mishap; but, strange to say, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, who was a <i lang="ms">haji</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10006src" href="#xd32e10006">154</a> and a slave-debtor of the Toh Puan Halimah, died about nine months afterwards.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10009src" href="#xd32e10009">155</a>
</p>
<p>There appears to be very little reason to doubt that the word <i lang="ms">Tualang</i> (<i lang="ms">’Toh Alang</i> or <i lang="ms">Sialang</i>) is the name not of a particular species of tree, but rather the generic name of
all trees in which wild bees have built their nests, so that in reality it simply
means a “Bee-Tree.”
</p>
<p>I have not yet succeeded in obtaining any of the Malay charms used by the collectors
of these bees’ nests, except such as are used by Sakais under Malay <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>influence on the Selangor coast, the Sakais being most usually the collectors. Some
of these latter, however, were pure Malay charms, and may perhaps be considered, in
the absence of charms collected from Malays, as evidence of at least secondary importance.
One of these charms commences as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Here is the Peeling-knife, the knife with the long handle,
</p>
<p class="line">Stuck into the buttress of a Pulai-Tree.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10032src" href="#xd32e10032">156</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">And another, which is almost word for word the same, as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Here is the Peeling-knife, the knife with the long handle,
</p>
<p class="line">With which to stab (lit. peck at) the buttress of the Pulai-Tree.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10043src" href="#xd32e10043">157</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">It will be noticed that both refer to the <i>Pulai</i>-tree by name, and not to the <i lang="ms">Tualang</i>. The footnote which I here quote with reference to the customs of Siak is, almost
word for word, equally true of the Bee-Trees in Selangor.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10056src" href="#xd32e10056">158</a>

<p>Other haunted trees (<i lang="ms">pokok bĕrhantu</i>) are the Jawi-jawi, the Jĕlotong, and Bĕrombong, of which the following tradition

<p>“All trees,” according to Malay tradition, “were planted by ‘the Prophet Elias,’<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10127src" href="#xd32e10127">159</a> and are in the ‘Prophet Noah’s’ charge. In the days of King Solomon, trees could
speak as well as birds and animals, and several of the trees now to be seen in the
forest are really metamorphosed human beings. Such are the ‘Jĕlotong’ and the ‘Bĕrombong,’
which in the days of King Solomon were bosom friends, until there broke out between
them an unfortunate quarrel, which terminated in ‘Si Jĕlotong’s’ lacing the skin of
‘Si Bĕrombong’ all over with stabs from his dagger, the effect of which stabs remains
visible to this day. Si Bĕrombong, on the other hand, cursed Si Jĕlotong with his
dying breath, praying that he might be turned into a tree without any buttresses to
support his trunk, a prayer which was, of course, duly fulfilled. Thus originated
the lack of buttresses at the base of the former tree, and the laced and slashed bark
of the latter.”

<h5 class="main"><i>The Eagle-wood Tree</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following account of Eagle-wood and of the tree which produces it is quoted from
the <i>Journal of the Straits Asiatic Society</i>:—
</p>
<p>“In Crawfurd’s Dictionary of the Malay Archipelago<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10152src" href="#xd32e10152">161</a> I find the following:—‘<i>Agila</i>, the Eagle-wood of commerce.—Its name in Malay and Javanese is <i lang="ms">kalambak</i> or <i lang="ms">kalambah</i>, but it is also known in these languages by that of <i lang="ms">gharu</i> or <i lang="ms">kayu gharu</i>, gharu-wood, a corruption of the Sanskrit <i lang="sa-Latn">agahru</i>.… There can be no doubt but that the perfumed wood is the result of disease in the
tree that yields it, produced by the thickening of the sap into a gum or resin.’
</p>
<p>“This ‘Eagle-wood of commerce,’ under its more familiar name <i lang="ms">gharu</i>, is one of the rarest and most valuable products of our Malayan jungles, and the
following notes may be of interest. They are the result of inquiries amongst the Malays
and <i lang="ms">Pawangs</i> in Ulu Muar and Johol, and I am indebted to Mr. L.&nbsp;J. Cazalas for much assistance
in obtaining the information contained in them.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">gharu</i>-tree is a tall forest tree, sometimes reaching the size of fifteen feet in diameter.
The bark is of a silvery gray colour, and the foliage close and <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>dense, of a dark hue. The Malay name for the tree is “<i lang="ms">tabak</i>,” and no other may be used by the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> when in search of the <i lang="ms">kayu gharu</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10200src" href="#xd32e10200">162</a> <i lang="ms">Gharu</i>, the diseased heart-wood of the <i lang="ms">tabak</i>, is found in trees of all sizes, even in trees of one foot in diameter, thus showing
that the disease attacks the tree at an early stage.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">gharu</i> is found in pockets, and may sometimes be discovered by the veins which run to these
pockets. In other trees the veins are absent, which renders the process of searching
more difficult. The tree is generally cut down and left to rot, which exposes the
<i lang="ms">gharu</i> in about six months.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Pockets’ are found to contain as much as 104 catties; a single tree has been known
to yield 400 catties.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10234src" href="#xd32e10234">163</a> <i lang="ms">Gharu</i> is seldom found in the sap-wood, generally in the heart-wood or <i lang="ms">tĕras</i>.
</p>
<p>“Many <i lang="ms">tabak</i>-trees do not contain <i lang="ms">gharu</i> at all. To select the right trees is the special province of the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> or wise man. The <i lang="ms">tabak</i>-trees are under the care of certain <i lang="ms">hantu</i> or wood-spirits, and it would be hopeless for the uninitiated to attempt to find
<i lang="ms">gharu</i>; even the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> has to be very careful.
</p>
<p>“The following is the process as far as I have been able to ascertain it:—
</p>
<p>“On the outskirts of the forest the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> must burn incense, and repeat the following charm or formula:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="ms">

</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>“There is no “<i lang="ms">pantang gharu</i>” except that the words “<i lang="ms">isi</i>” and “<i lang="ms">tabak</i>” must be used instead of “<i lang="ms">tras</i>” and “<i lang="ms">gharu</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10354src" href="#xd32e10354">169</a>
</p>
<p>“He then proceeds to search for a likely tree, and upon finding one he again burns
incense and repeats the spell as above. The tree having been cut down, the next thing
is to separate the <i lang="ms">gharu</i> from the sap-wood. The best way is to let the tree rot, but the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> is often “hard-up,” and does not mind wasting some of the <i lang="ms">gharu</i> in his hurry to realise.
</p>
<p>“The following are said to be the tests for finding <i lang="ms">gharu</i> in a standing tree:—
</p>
<ul>

</p>
<p>“There are great differences in the quality of <i lang="ms">gharu</i>, and great care is taken in classifying them. It requires <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>a skilled man to distinguish between some of the varieties.
</p>
<p>“The names are as follow:—

<p>“The <i lang="ms">chandan</i> (<i lang="ms">pada tiada champur</i>) is oily, black, and glistening. It sinks in water.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">tadak</i> very closely resembles the <i lang="ms">chandan</i>.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">menjulong-ulong</i> may be distinguished from the <i lang="ms">chandan</i> and the <i lang="ms">tandok</i> by its length and small breadth. Splinters, 36 inches long, have been found evidently
from veins, not pockets.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10541src" href="#xd32e10541">173</a>
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Sikat</i> (<i lang="ms">bertabun champur kubal dan tĕras</i>), fibrous, with slight lustre, will just float in water. Black and white streaks.

<p>“<i lang="ms">Sikat lampam</i>—the same as <i lang="ms">sikat</i>, only white streaks more prominent.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Bulu Rusa</i> will float in water, fibrous, generally of a yellow colour.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Kemandangan</i> floats in water, whitish, fibrous fragments small.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Wangkang</i> floats in water, fibrous blocks whitish in colour.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">chandan</i> tree differs from other <i lang="ms">gharu</i>-trees in having a maximum diameter of about 1½ feet, and very soft sap-wood.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Gharu</i> varies in price between 200 and 50 dollars <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>a <i lang="ms">pikul</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10615src" href="#xd32e10615">174</a> according to the variety. The <i lang="ms">chandan</i> and the <i lang="ms">tandok</i> are the most valuable.
</p>
<p>“Chinese and Malays burn it in their houses on high days and festivals—the latter
generally take a supply with them on the pilgrimage to Mecca. The better varieties
are used in the manufacture of aromatic oils.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10629src" href="#xd32e10629">175</a>
</p>
<p>Before setting out to search for <i lang="ms">gharu</i>, the <i lang="ms">gharu</i>-wizard burns incense and repeats these words, “O Grandsire Duita, Divinity of Eagle-wood,
if you are far, be so good as to say so; if you are near, be so good as to say so,”
and then sets out on his quest. On finding a <i lang="ms">karas</i>-tree he chops the bark of the trunk lightly with his cutlass, and then puts his ear
to the trunk to listen. If he hears a kind of low singing, or rather whispering noise
(<i lang="ms">bunyi ting ting</i>) in the tree, he takes this as a signification that the tree contains <i lang="ms">gharu</i> (<i lang="ms">isi</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10657src" href="#xd32e10657">176</a> and after marking the bark with a cross (<i lang="ms">silang ampat</i>) he collects wood to build a temporary shelter (<i lang="ms">pondong</i>) for himself, and when about to plant the first post repeats the following charm:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O Grandsire Batara of the Earth, Earth-Genie, Earth-Spirit,
</p>
<p class="line">Idol of Iron, Son of Wani, Solitary Wani,
</p>
<p class="line">Son of Wayah, Bandan the Solitary,
</p>
<p class="line">I ask you to show me (an eagle-wood tree),
</p>
<p class="line">If you do not do so
</p>
<p class="line">You shall be a rebel against God,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The result of this invocation is, or should be, that the <i lang="ms">gharu</i>-spirit appears to the wizard (generally, no <span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>doubt, in a dream), and informs him what kind of sacrifice he requires on this particular
occasion. Whatever kind of sacrifice is asked for, must of course be given, <i>with the exception of a human sacrifice which, as it is expressly stated, may be compounded
by the sacrifice of a fowl</i>.
</p>
<p>When the tree has been felled you must be exceedingly careful to see that nobody passes
between the end of the fallen trunk and the stump; whoever does so will surely be
killed by the “eagle-wood spirit,” who is supposed to be extremely powerful and dangerous.
I myself received a warning to this effect from some Labu Malays when I saw one of
these trees felled. Malays maintain that men are frequently killed by this spirit
(<i lang="ms">mati dĕ’ Hantu Gharu</i>), but that they may be recalled to life if the following recipe is acted upon:—“Take
two ‘cubits’ (?) of ‘Panchong leaves’ (<i lang="ms">daun panchong dua heta</i>), flowers of the <i lang="ms">sunting mambang</i>, and ‘bullock’s eye’ limes (<i lang="ms">limau mata kĕrbau</i>), squeeze [the limes(?)] and rub them over the corpse, saying, ‘Sir Allah! Sir Mangga
Tangan! God’s Essence is in your heart (lit. liver). God’s attributes are in your
eyes. Go and entertain the male Borer-Bee that is in your heart and liver.’ <i>The dead man will then revive and stand upon his feet.</i>”
</p>
<p>The most important point about eagle-wood, however, from the animistic point of view,
is the <i lang="ms">Pawang’s</i> use of the <i lang="ms">gharu mĕrupa</i>, a strangely shaped piece of eagle-wood which possesses a natural resemblance to
some animal or bird. It is believed to contain the soul of the tree, and therefore
is always, when possible, carried by the collectors of eagle-wood in the belief that
it will aid them in their search. I myself once owned one of these <i lang="ms">gharu mĕrupa</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>which possessed a remarkable resemblance to a bird. This appears to me very fairly
sufficient evidence to prove that the tree-soul is not supposed by the Malays necessarily
to resemble a tree.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10714src" href="#xd32e10714">177</a>

<h5 class="main"><i>Camphor</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following account of the superstitious notions connected with the search for Camphor
(<i lang="ms">kapur Barus</i>) is extracted from a paper by Messrs. H. Lake and H.&nbsp;J. Kelsall<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10761src" href="#xd32e10761">178</a>:—
</p>
<p>“The chief interest attaching to the Kapur Barus in Johor lies in the superstitions
connected with the collection of the camphor by the natives, or <i lang="ms">Orang Hulu</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10772src" href="#xd32e10772">179</a>
</p>
<p>“Amongst these superstitions the most important is the use of a special language,
the subject of the present paper, which has been the means of preserving some remnants
of the aboriginal dialects of this part of the Malay Peninsula. This language is called
by the <i lang="ms">Orang Hulu</i> “Pantang Kapur”; <i lang="ms">pantang</i> means forbidden or tabooed, and in this case refers to the fact that in searching
for the camphor the use of the ordinary Malay language is <i lang="ms">pantang</i>, or forbidden. In addition to this there are restrictions as to food, etc.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>“This Camphor language is first referred to by Mr. Logan in his account of the aboriginal
tribes of the Malay Peninsula,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10800src" href="#xd32e10800">180</a> and he gives a list of eighty words, thirty-three of which are Malay or derived from
Malay.”
</p>
<p>“The Jakuns believe that there is a “<i lang="ms">bisan</i>,” or spirit, which presides over the camphor-trees, and without propitiating this
spirit it is impossible to obtain the camphor. This <i lang="ms">bisan</i> makes at night a shrill noise, and when this sound is heard it is a sure sign that
there are camphor-trees near at hand. (This <i lang="ms">bisan</i> is really one of the Cicadas which are so numerous in the Malayan jungles.)
</p>
<p>“When hunting for camphor the natives always throw a portion of their food out into
the jungle before eating, as an offering to the <i lang="ms">bisan</i>.
</p>
<p>“No prayers are offered up, but all food must be eaten dry, <i>i.e.</i> without <i>sumbul</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10830src" href="#xd32e10830">181</a> or stewed fish, or vegetables. Salt must not be pounded fine; if it is eaten fine,
the camphor when found will be in fine grains; but if eaten coarse the grains of camphor
will be large. In rainy weather the cry of the <i>bisan</i> is not heard. At certain seasons regular parties of Jakuns, and sometimes Malays,
go into the jungle to search for camphor, and they remain there as long as three or
four months at a time. Not only must the men who go into the jungle to search for
the camphor speak the ‘Pantang Kapur,’ but also the men and women left at home in
the Kampongs.
</p>
<p>“The camphor occurs in the form of small grains deposited in the cracks in the interior
of the trunk <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>of the tree. Camphor is only found in the older trees, and not in all of these, and
to obtain it the tree must be cut down and split up. There are certain signs which
indicate when a tree contains camphor, one of which is the smell emitted from the
wood when chipped. A man who is skilled in detecting the presence of camphor is called
Penghulu Kapur.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10842src" href="#xd32e10842">182</a> The camphor when taken away from the tree is washed, and all chips of wood and dirt
carefully removed, and it is then sold to Chinese traders at Kwala Indau at prices
varying according to the quality from $15 to $40 per <i>katti</i>.
</p>
<p>“The Camphor language consists in great part of words which are either Malay or of
Malay origin, but contains, as above mentioned, a large number of words which are
not Malay, but which are presumably remnants of the original Jakun dialects, which
are apparently almost obsolete otherwise in the Indau and Sembrong districts of Johor.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10853src" href="#xd32e10853">183</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following rules have an evident bearing upon the subject of vegetable animism.
They were collected at Langat, in Selangor:—
</p>
<p>The time to plant Sugar-cane is at noon: this will make it sweeter, by drying up the
juice and leaving the saccharine matter. If you plant it in the early morning its
joints will be too long, if in the middle of the day they will be short.
</p>
<p>Plant Maize with a full stomach, and let your dibble be thick, as this will swell
the maize ear.
</p>
<p>For Plantains (or Bananas) you must dig a big hole, and the evening is the time to
plant them. The evening is the quicker, and if planted after the evening meal they
fill out better.
</p>
<p>Plant Sweet Potatoes on a starry night to ensure their filling out properly (by getting

<p>Plant Cucumbers and Gourds on a dark moonless <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>night, to prevent them from being seen and devoured by fire-flies (<i lang="ms">api-api</i>).
</p>
<p>Plant Cocoa-nuts when the stomach is overburdened with food (<i lang="ms">kalau kita ’nak sangat berak</i>); run quickly and throw the cocoa-nut into the hole prepared for it without straightening
the arm; if you straighten it the fruit-stalk will break. Plant them in the evening,
so that they may bear fruit while they are still near the ground. When you pick seed
cocoa-nuts off the tree somebody should stand at the bottom of the tree and watch
whether the “monkey-face” of each seed cocoa-nut, as it is thrown down, turns either
towards himself or the base of the tree, or whether it looks away from both. In the
former case the seed will be good, in the latter it is not worth planting.

(the Rice Soul being considered as an infant) get up.

<h5 class="main"><i>The Cultivation of Rice</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most important contribution of the Malays to the animistic theory of vegetation
is perhaps to be found in the many strange ceremonies with which they surround the
culture of Rice. In order to properly understand the significance of these ceremonies,
however, a proper understanding of the Malay system of rice-planting is essential,
and I therefore quote <i lang="la">in extenso</i> a description of rice-culture, which possesses the additional interest of being translated
from the composition of a Malay:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11006src" href="#xd32e11006">186</a>—
</p>
<p>“It is the established custom in Malacca territory <span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>to plant rice once a year, and the season for doing so generally falls about the month
of Zilkaʿidah or Zilhijah.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11013src" href="#xd32e11013">187</a>
</p>
<p>“In starting planting operations, however, the object is, if possible, to coincide
with the season when the West wind blows, because at that time there are frequent
rains, and accordingly the earth of the rice-field becomes soft and easy to plough.
Moreover, in planting rice it is an invariable rule that there must be water in the
field, in order that the rice may sprout properly; though, on the other hand, if there
is too great a depth of water the rice is sure to die. It has also been observed that
as a rule the season of the West wind coincides with the fourth month<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11018src" href="#xd32e11018">188</a> of the Chinese calendar, and sometimes also with the month of Zilkaʿidah or Zilhijah.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11021src" href="#xd32e11021">189</a>
</p>
<p>“2. In olden time the order of planting operations was as follows:—First, the elders
had to hold a consultation with the Pawang; then the date was fixed; then <i lang="ms">Maulud</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11037src" href="#xd32e11037">190</a> prayers were read over the ‘mother-seed,’ and benzoin, (incense) supplied by the
<i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, was burned; then all the requisites for rice-planting were got ready, viz.:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">“(1)</span> A strong buffalo (to pull the plough).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2)</span> A plough with its appurtenances (to turn over the earth and the short weeds).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3)</span> A harrow with its appurtenances (to level and break up small the clods of earth left
by the plough).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(4)</span> A roller with its appurtenances (to knock down the long weeds, such as sedges, in
fields that have lain fallow for a long while).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(5)</span> A wood-cutter’s knife, to mend any of the implements that may get out of order at
the time of ploughing.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(6)</span> A hoe to repair the embankments and level the higher grounds.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(7)</span> A scythe<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11074src" href="#xd32e11074">191</a> to cut the long weeds.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(8)</span> And a whip to urge the buffalo on if he is lazy.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>“3. When the proper season has arrived for beginning the work of planting, and the
elders have come to an agreement with the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, then on some Friday after the service in the Mosque the Pĕnghulu addresses all the
people there present, saying that on such a day of the month every one who is to take
part in rice-cultivation must bring to the Mosque half a quart of grain (for ‘mother-seed’)
in order that <i lang="ms">Maulud</i> prayers may be read over it. (At that time <i lang="ms">kĕtupats</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11097src" href="#xd32e11097">192</a> and <i lang="ms">lĕpats</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11102src" href="#xd32e11102">193</a> are prepared for the men who are to read those prayers.)
</p>
<p>“When the <i lang="ms">Maulud</i> prayers are over, every man goes down to the rice-field, if possible on the same
day or the next one, in order to begin ploughing the nursery plot, that is, the plot
which is near his house or in which he has been in the habit of sowing the seed every
year.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>“But if a man has a great number of plots, he will begin by ploughing half of them,
and then at the end of the month of Zilhijah he must diligently prepare the nursery
plot so as to be ready in about ten days’ time.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div4 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><i>Of Sowing</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“4. Before sowing one must first of all lay out the grain, both the seed-grain and
the ‘mother-seed,’ each separately, to dry. It must then be soaked in a vessel (a
bucket or pot) for two days and two nights, after which it is taken out, strained
and spread quite evenly on a mat with fresh leaves (areca-nut fronds are best), and
every afternoon one must sprinkle water on it in order that the germ may quickly break
through, which will happen probably in two days’ time or thereabouts.
</p>
<p>“5. While the seed is soaking, the nursery plot must be carefully prepared; that is
to say, it must be ploughed over again, harrowed, levelled, ditched, and the soil
allowed to settle; the embankments must be mended, and the surface made smooth. When
the germs have sprouted the seed is taken to the nursery plot. Benzoin supplied by
the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> is burnt, and the plot sprinkled with <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11130src" href="#xd32e11130">194</a> Then a beginning is made by sowing the ‘chief of the seed,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘mother-seed,’ in one corner of the nursery prepared for the purpose, and about two
yards square; afterwards the rest of the seed is sown all over the plot. It is well
to sow when the plot contains plenty of water, so that all the germs of the seed may
be <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>uppermost, and the roots may not grow long, but may be pulled up easily. <i>The time for sowing must be during the dark half of the month, so that the seedlings
may be preserved from being eaten by insects.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11166src" href="#xd32e11166">195</a>
</p>
<p>“Three days after the seed is sown the young shoots begin to rise like needles, and
at that time all the water should be drawn off the plot; after seven days they are
likened to a sparrow’s tail, and about the tenth or fifteenth day they break out into
blades. At that period the water is again let into the plot, little by little, in
order that the stalks of the seedlings may grow thick.
</p>
<p>“The seedlings have to remain in the nursery for at least forty or forty-four days
from the time of sowing before they are sufficiently grown; it is best to let them
remain till they are about seventy days old.
</p>
<p>“6. While the seedlings are in the nursery the other plots are being ploughed, one
after another; and this is called the first ploughing. Then the embankments are mended
and re-formed with earth, so that the water in the field may not escape and leave
it dry. After the embankments have been mended the harrowing begins: a start is made
with the plot that was first ploughed (other than the nursery plot), for there the
earth will have become soft, and the weeds being rotten after many days of soaking
in the water will form a sort of manure. Each plot is so dealt with in its turn. Then
all have to be ploughed once more (which is called the second ploughing) and harrowed
again; for the first harrowing merely breaks up the clods of earth, and a second is
required to reduce them to a fine state and to kill the weeds. Most people, having
first used an iron harrow, use a wooden one <span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>for the second harrowing, in order that the earth may be broken up quite fine. Their
rice is sure to thrive better than that of people who are less careful; for in rice-planting,
as the saying goes, there is ‘the plighted hope of good that is to come,’ in the way
of bodily sustenance I mean. So day by day the different plots are treated in the
way that has been described in connection with the nursery plot in paragraph 5 above.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div4 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><i>Of Planting</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“7. When the seedling rice has been in the nursery long enough, and the fields are
clean and ready for planting (which will be about the month of Safar, or August) the
seedlings are pulled up and tied together with strips of dried <i lang="ms">palas</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11182src" href="#xd32e11182">196</a> leaves into bundles of the size known as <i lang="ms">sachekak</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the space enclosed by the thumb and the index finger when their ends meet). If the
roots and blades are long the ends can be clipped a little, and the roots are then
steeped in manure. This manure is made of buffalo bones burnt with chaff till they
are thoroughly calcined, and then pounded fine, passed through a sieve and mixed with
mud: that is the best kind of manure for rice-planting, and is known as ‘stock manure.’
(It can also be applied by merely scattering it in the fields. In that case, after
cutting off the ends of the blades, the seedlings are planted, and afterwards, when
they are green again and appear to be thriving, the manure is scattered over the whole
field. There are some places, too, where no manure at all is used because of the perennial
richness of the soil.)
<span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Afterwards the seedlings are allowed to remain exposed to the air for about two nights,
and then taken to the field to be planted. The bundles are broken up, and bunches
of four or five plants together are planted at intervals of a span all over the different
plots till all are filled up. If there are very many plots, ten or fifteen female
labourers can be engaged to assist in planting, and likewise in pulling up the seedlings,
at a wage of four cents for every hundred bundles.

<p class="first">“8. Ten days after the young rice has been transplanted it recovers its fresh green
colour; in thirty days the young shoots come out; in the second month it increases
more and more, and in the third it becomes even all over. After three months and a
half its growth is stayed, and in the fourth month it is styled <i lang="ms">bunting kĕchil</i>.
</p>
<p>“At that stage the stalk has only five joints, and from that period it must be fumigated
daily till the grain appears.
</p>
<p>“About the time when the stalk has six joints it is called <i lang="ms">bunting bĕsar</i>; in forty days more the grain is visible here and there, and twenty days later it
spreads everywhere. At this time all the water in the field must be drawn off so that
the grain may ripen quickly. After five or six days it ripens in patches, and a few
days later the rice is altogether ripe.
</p>
<p>“From the time of transplanting to the time when it is ripe is reckoned six months,
not counting the days spent in ploughing and in growing it in the nursery, which may
be a month or two, or even (if <span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>there are many plots) as much as three months to the end of the ploughing.

<h5 class="main"><span class="sc">Of Reaping and taking the Soul of the Rice</span></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“9. When one wishes to begin reaping the grain one must first have the Pawang’s permission,
and burn benzoin supplied by him in the field.
</p>
<p>“The following implements must be got ready, viz.:—
</p>
<p>“(1) A small basket to hold the rice cut first, known as the ‘Soul of the Rice’ (<i lang="ms">sĕmangat padi</i>).
</p>
<p>(2) A <i lang="ms">jari lipan</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11228src" href="#xd32e11228">197</a> to put round the small basket.
</p>
<p>(3) A string of <i lang="ms">tĕrap</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11239src" href="#xd32e11239">198</a> bark to tie up the rice that is cut first.
</p>
<p>(4) A small stem of bamboo, of the variety known as <i lang="ms">buloh kasap</i>, with a flag attached, which is to be planted in the small basket as a sign of the
‘Soul of the Rice’ that has been cut first.
</p>
<p>(5) A small white cloth to wrap up the ‘Soul of the Rice.’
</p>
<p>(6) An <i lang="ms">anchak</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11254src" href="#xd32e11254">199</a> to hold the brasier.
</p>
<p>(7) A brasier, in which to burn the incense provided by the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>.
</p>
<p>(8) A nail and a kind of nut, known as <i lang="ms">buah kĕras</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11267src" href="#xd32e11267">200</a> to be put into the <i lang="ms">anchak</i> together with the brasier.
</p>
<p>“When the rice is ripe all over, one must first take the ‘Soul’ out of all the plots
of one’s field. You choose the spot where the rice is best and where it is ‘female’
(that is to say, where the bunch of stalks is big) and where there are seven joints
in the stalk. You begin with a bunch of this kind and clip seven stems to be the ‘soul
of the rice’; and then you clip yet another handful to be the ‘mother-seed’ for <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>the following year. The ‘Soul’ is wrapped in a white cloth tied with a cord of <i lang="ms">tĕrap</i> bark, and made into the shape of a little child in swaddling clothes, and put into
the small basket. The ‘mother-seed’ is put into another basket, and both are fumigated
with benzoin, and then the two baskets are piled the one on the other and taken home,
and put into the <i lang="ms">kĕpuk</i> (the receptacle in which the rice is stored).
</p>
<p>“10. One must wait three days (called the <i lang="ms">pantang tuai</i>) before one may clip or cut any more of the rice. At first only one or two basketfuls
of rice are cut; the rice is dried in the sun, winnowed in a winnowing basket, and
cleaned in a fanning machine, pounded to free it from the husk, so that it becomes
<i lang="ms">bĕras</i> (husked rice), and then boiled so that it becomes <i lang="ms">nasi</i> (cooked rice), and people are invited to feast on it.
</p>
<p>“11. Then a bucket is made for the purpose of threshing the rest of the rice, and
a granary built to keep it in while it remains in the field, and five or six labourers
are engaged to reap and thresh it (<i lang="ms">banting</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11302src" href="#xd32e11302">201</a> Their hours of working are from 6 to 11.30 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, and all the rice they thresh they put into the granary.
</p>
<p>“12. If the crop is a good one a gallon of seed will produce a hundredfold. Each plot
in a field takes about a gallon of seed.
</p>
<p>“13. When the rice has all been cut it is winnowed in order to get rid of the chaff,
and then laid out in the sun till quite dry, so that it may not get mouldy if kept
for a year.
</p>
<p>“Then the wages of the labourers are taken out of it at the rate of two gallons out
of every ten. When <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>that is settled, if the rice is not to be sold, it is taken home and put into the
rice-chest.
</p>
<p>“Whenever you want to eat of it, you take out a basketful at a time and dry it in
the sun. Then you turn it in the winnowing basket, and clean it in the fanning machine,
pound it to convert it into <i lang="ms">bĕras</i>, and put a sufficiency of it in a pot and wash it. Enough water is then poured over
it to cover it, and it is put on the kitchen fire till it is boiled and becomes <i lang="ms">nasi</i>, when it can be eaten.
</p>
<p>“14. The custom of reaping with a sickle (<i lang="ms">sabit</i>) and threshing the rice as described in paragraph 11 is a modern method, and is at
present mainly practised by the people living in the neighbourhood of the town of
Malacca, in order to get the work done quickly; but in olden times it was not allowed,
and even to this day the people who live in the inland parts of the territory of Malacca
prefer to clip their rice with a <i lang="ms">tuai</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11333src" href="#xd32e11333">202</a> and put it into their baskets a handful at a time [<i>i.e.</i> without threshing it]. (If labourers are employed to do this their wage is one-tenth
of the rice cut.) It takes ever so many days to get the work done, but the idea is
that this method is the pious one, the ‘Soul of the Rice’ not being disturbed thereby.
A good part of the people hold this belief, and assert that since the custom of threshing
the rice has been introduced, the crops have been much less abundant than in years
of olden time when it was the custom to use the <i lang="ms">tuai</i> only.
</p>
<p>“15. If a man has broad fields so that he is unable to plant them all by his own labour,
he will often allow another to work them on an agreement, either of equal <span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>division of the produce (each bearing an equal share of the hire of a buffalo and
all other expenses incidental to rice-planting), or of threefold division (that is,
for example, the owner bears all expenses, in which case the man who does the work
can get a third of the produce; or the latter bears all expenses, in which case the
owner only gets a third of the produce). Or again, the land can be let; for instance,
a field which ordinarily produces a <i lang="ms">koyan</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11358src" href="#xd32e11358">203</a> of rice a year will fetch a rent of about two hundred gallons more or less.
</p>
<p>“16. Every cultivator who does not act in accordance with the ordinance laid down
in paragraphs 9 and 10 above, will be in the same case as if he disregarded all the
prohibitions laid down in connection with planting. If a man does not carry out this
procedure he is sure to fail in the end; his labour will be in vain and will not fulfil
his desires, for the virtue of all these ordinances and prohibitions lies in the fact
that they protect the rice, and drive away all its enemies, such as grubs, rats, swine,
and the like.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11395src" href="#xd32e11395">204</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ceremony to be observed at the sowing of the rice-seed was thus described to me
by the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> who performed the reaping ceremony described below:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>“First arrange four poles upon the ground, so as to form a rectangular frame (<i lang="ms">galang dapor</i>), in the middle of the clearing. Then plant in succession at the four corners—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">“1.</span> A young banana-tree.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2.</span> A plant of lemon grass (<i lang="ms">sĕrai</i>).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">3.</span> A stem of sugar-cane (of the kind called <i lang="ms">lanjong</i>).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">4.</span> A plant of saffron (<i lang="ms">kunyit</i>).</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Perform the operation carefully, so that they are all likely to live.
</p>
<p>“In the centre of the ground enclosed by the frame deposit a cocoa-nut shell full
of water.
</p>
<p>“Early next morning go out and observe the omens. If the frame has moved aside (<i lang="ms">bĕrkuak</i>) ever so little, or if the water has been spilt, it is a bad omen. But if not, and
if the water in the cocoa-nut shell has not been spilt, or if a black ant (<i lang="ms">sĕmut</i>) or a white ant (<i lang="ms">anei-anei</i>) is found in the water, it is a good sign.
</p>
<p>“When good omens have been obtained, proceed by planting rice-seed in seven holes
with a dibble of <i lang="ms">satambun</i> wood, repeating the following charm:—

<h5 class="main"><span class="sc">The Planting out of the Young Rice</span></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following account (by Mr. C.&nbsp;O. Blagden) of the ceremony of planting out the young
rice (from the <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>rice-nursery) appeared in the <i>Journal of the Straits Asiatic Society</i> in 1896:—
</p>
<p>“In agricultural operations the animistic ideas of the Malays are clearly apparent:
thus, before the rice is cut a sort of ritual is performed which is known as <i lang="ms">puji padi</i>, and which is regarded, apparently, as a kind of propitiatory service, a sort of
apology to the <i lang="ms">padi</i> (rice) for reaping it. The <i lang="ms">padi</i> is usually sprinkled with <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i> (flour mixed with water) before the reaping is commenced, and the first lot cut is
set apart for a ceremonial feast.
</p>
<p>“At planting there are also ceremonies: as a rule the beginning of the planting season
is ushered in by a visit of the whole body of villagers to the most highly revered
<i lang="ms">kramat</i> in the neighbourhood, where the usual offerings are made and prayers are said. Sometimes,
however, there is a special service known as <i lang="ms">băpua</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11511src" href="#xd32e11511">206</a> consisting of a sort of mock combat, in which the evil spirits are believed to be
expelled from the rice-fields by the villagers: this is not done every year, but once
in three or four years.
</p>
<p>“Another occasional service of a peculiar character, which is not of very frequent
occurrence, is the ceremony which would perhaps be best described as the propitiation
of the earth-spirit. Some years ago I happened, by chance, to be present at a function
of this kind, and as its details may be of some interest as illustrating the wide
dispersion of certain points of ritual, I will end these notes by giving a full description
of it as noted down at the time. It was in the month of October, and I happened to
be out shooting <span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>snipe in the <i lang="ms">padi</i>-fields of the village of Sĕbatu on a Sunday morning, when I was met by the <i lang="ms">Pĕnghulu</i>, the headman of the village, who asked me to leave off shooting for an hour or so.
As I was having fair sport, I naturally wanted to know the reason why, so he explained
that the noise of gunshots would irritate the <i lang="ms">hantu</i>, and render unavailing the propitiatory service which was then about to begin. Further
inquiry elicited the statement that the <i lang="ms">hantu</i> in question was the one who presided over rice-lands and agricultural operations,
and as I was told that there would be no objection to my attending the ceremony, I
went there and then to the spot to watch the proceedings. The place was a square patch
of grass-lawn a few yards wide, which had evidently for years been left untouched
by the plough, though surrounded by many acres of rice-fields. On this patch a small
wooden altar had been built: it consisted simply of a small square platform of wood
or bamboo raised about three or four feet above the ground, each corner being supported
by a small sapling with the leaves and branches left on it and overshadowing the platform,
the sides of which appeared to face accurately towards the four cardinal points. To
the western side was attached a small bamboo ladder leading from the ground to the
edge of the platform. At the four corners of the patch of grass were four larger saplings
planted in the ground. On the branches of all these trees were hung a number of <i lang="ms">kĕtupats</i>, which are small squarish bags plaited of strips of the leaves of the screw-pine
(<i lang="ms">mĕngkuang</i>) or some similar plant, like the material of which native bags and mats are made.
A larger <i lang="ms">kĕtupat</i> hung over the centre of the altar, and all of them were filled with a preparation
of boiled rice. On the altar were piled up <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>various cooked foods laid on plantain leaves, including the flesh of a goat cooked
in the ordinary way, as well as rice and different kinds of condiments and sweetmeats.
The <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> was present as well as a number of the villagers, and soon after my arrival with
the <i lang="ms">Pĕnghulu</i> the ceremony began by some of the villagers producing out of a bag the skin of a
black male goat with the head and horns attached and containing the entrails (the
flesh having been cooked and laid on the altar previously). A large iron nail four
or five inches long, and thick in proportion, was placed vertically in a hole about
two feet deep which had been dug under the altar, and the remains of the goat were
also buried in it, with the head turned towards the east, the hole being then closed
and the turf replaced. Some of the goat’s blood, in two cocoa-nut shells (<i lang="ms">tĕmpurong</i>), was placed on the ground near the south side and south-west corner of the altar
close to the ladder.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, after assisting at these preliminaries, then took his stand at the west side of
the altar, looking eastward: he covered his head, but not his face, with his <i lang="ms">sarong</i> wrapped round it like a shawl, and proceeded to light a torch, the end of which was
tipped with incense (<i lang="ms">kĕmĕnyan</i>). With this he touched the bottom of the altar platform four times. He then took
a cup of <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i> and dipped in it a small bundle of four kinds of leaves, with which he then sprinkled
the north-west and south-east corners of the platform. He then coughed three times—whether
this was part of the ritual, or a purely incidental occurrence, I am unable to say,
as it was not practicable to stop the ceremony for the purpose of asking questions—and
again applied the torch under the altar and sprinkled with <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i> all the corners of it, as well as the rungs of the ladder.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>“At this stage of the proceedings four men stationed in the rice-field beyond the
four corners of the patch of turf, each threw a <i lang="ms">kĕtupat</i> diagonally across to one another, while the rest of the assembly, headed by the <i lang="ms">Pĕnghulu</i>, chanted the <i lang="ms">kalimah</i>, or Muhammadan creed, three times.
</p>
<p>“Then a man holding a large bowl started from a point in the rice-field just outside
the north side of the patch of turf, and went round it (first in a westerly direction).
As he walked, he put handfuls of the rice into his mouth and spat or vomited them
out, with much noise, as if to imitate violent nausea, into the field. He was followed
closely by another who also held a bowl filled with pieces of raw tapioca root and
<i lang="ms">bĕras bĕrtih</i> (rice roasted in a peculiar way),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11596src" href="#xd32e11596">207</a> which he threw about into the field. Both of them went right round the grass plot.
The <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> then took his cup of <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i> and sprinkled the <i lang="ms">anak padi</i>, that is, the rice-shoots which were lying in bundles along the south and east sides
of the altar ready for planting. Having sprinkled them he cut off the ends, as is
usually done; and after spitting to the right and to the left, he proceeded to plant
them in the field. A number of others then followed his lead and planted the rest
of the rice-plants, and then a sweetmeat made of cocoa-nut and sugar was handed round,
and Muhammadan prayers were said by some duly qualified person, an <i lang="ms">orang ʿalim</i> or a <i lang="ms">lĕbei</i>, and the ceremony was concluded.
</p>
<p>“It was explained to me that the blood and the food were intended for the <i lang="ms">hantu</i>, and the ladder up to the altar was for his convenience; in fact the whole affair
was a propitiatory service, and offers curious analogies with the sacrificial ceremonials
of some of the wild <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>aboriginal tribes of Central India who have not been converted to Hinduism or Islām.
That it should exist in a Malay community within twenty miles of the town of Malacca,
where Muhammadanism has been established for about six<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11624src" href="#xd32e11624">208</a> centuries, is certainly strange. Its obvious inconsistency with his professed religion
does not strike the average Malay peasant at all. It is, however, the fact that these
observances are not regarded with much favour by the more strictly Muhammadan Malays
of the towns, and especially by those that are partially of Arab descent. These latter
have not much influence in country districts, but privately I have heard some of them
express disapproval of such rites and even of the ceremonies performed at <i>kramats</i>. According to them, the latter might be consistent with Muhammadan orthodoxy on the
understanding that prayers were addressed solely to the Deity; but the invocation
of spirits or deceased saints and their propitiation by offerings could not be regarded
as otherwise than polytheistic idolatry. Of course such a delicate distinction—almost
as subtle as that between <i>dulia</i> and <i>latria</i> in the Christian worship of saints—is entirely beyond the average Malay mind; and
everything is sanctioned by immemorial custom, which in an agricultural population
is more deeply-rooted than any book-learning; so these rites are likely to continue
for some time, and will only yield gradually to the spread of education. Such as they
are, they seem to be interesting relics of an old-world superstition.
</p>
<p>“I have mentioned only a few such points, and only such as have been brought directly
to my knowledge; there are hosts of other quaint notions, such as the theory <span class="pageNum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>of lucky and unlucky days and hours, on which whole treatises have been written, and
which regulate every movement of those who believe in them; the belief in amulets
and charms for averting all manner of evils, supernatural and natural; the practice
during epidemics of sending out to sea small elaborately constructed vessels which
are supposed to carry off the malignant spirits responsible for the disease (of which
I remember a case a few years ago in the village of Sempang, where the beneficial
effect was most marked); the widespread belief in the power of <i lang="ms">mĕnuju</i>, that is, doing injury at a distance by magic, in which the Malays believe the wild
junglemen especially to be adepts; the belief in the efficacy of forms of words as
love-charms and as a protection against spirits and wild beasts—in fact, an innumerable
variety of superstitious ideas exist among Malays.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11641src" href="#xd32e11641">209</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the 28th January 1897 I witnessed (at Chodoi, in the Kuala Langat district of Selangor)
the ceremony of fetching home the Rice-soul<span id="xd32e11654"></span>.
</p>
<p><i>Time of Ceremony.</i>—I arrived at the house belonging to the Malay owner of the rice-field a little past
8 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, the hour at which the ceremony was to take place having been fixed at <i lang="ms">angkat kĕning</i> (about 9 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>) a few days previously. On my arrival I found the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> (sorceress), an aged Selangor woman, seated in front of the baskets required for
the ceremony.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11671src" href="#xd32e11671">210</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Accessories.</i>—At her extreme left stood one of the circular brass trays with high sides which are
called <i lang="ms">dulang</i> by the Malays, containing the following objects:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1.</span> A small bowl of “parched rice” (<i lang="ms">b’ras bĕr’tih</i>).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2.</span> A small bowl of “saffron rice” (<i lang="ms">b’ras kunyit</i>).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">3.</span> A small bowl of “washed rice” (<i lang="ms">b’ras basoh</i>).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">4.</span> A small bowl of “oil of frankincense.”</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">5.</span> A small bowl of “oil of Celebes” (<i lang="ms">minyak Bugis</i>).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">6.</span> A small bowl of “incense” (<i lang="ms">kĕm’nyan</i>).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">7.</span> A small bundle of incense (in addition to the bowl).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">8.</span> One of the hard jungle-nuts called <i lang="ms">buah k’ras</i> (the candle-nut).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">9.</span> One of the shells called <i lang="ms">k’rang</i> (a cockle shell).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">10.</span> A hen’s egg.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">11.</span> A stone (a small block of quartz).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">12.</span> A large iron nail.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">13 to 15.</span> Three Malay reaping instruments (<i lang="ms">pĕnuwei</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11773src" href="#xd32e11773">211</a></li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Close to the <i lang="ms">dulang</i> stood a cocoa-nut shell filled with the <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>, which plays so prominent a part in Malay magic ceremonies, and a brush made up of
the leaves of seven different plants, bound up as usual with a cord of <i lang="ms">kulit t’rap</i> (the bark of the Wild Breadfruit), and <i lang="ms">ribu-ribu</i> (a kind of small creeper). The plants which supplied the leaves of which the brush
was composed, were as follows:—
</p>
<p>1. <i lang="ms">Sapĕnoh.</i> 2. <i lang="ms">Sapanggil.</i> 3. <i lang="ms">Jĕnjuang</i> (or <i lang="ms">lĕnjuang</i>) <i lang="ms">merah</i> (the Red Dracæna). 4. <i lang="ms">Gandarusa.</i> 5. <i lang="ms">Pulut-pulut.</i> 6. <i lang="ms">Sĕlaguri.</i> 7. <i lang="ms">Sambau dara</i> (a kind of grass).
</p>
<p>But the most interesting object was a small oval-shaped <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>basket bound with the <i lang="ms">ribu-ribu</i> creeper, and about fourteen inches long, which was standing just in front of the
three rice-baskets and close to the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, and which, as I afterwards found out, was intended to serve as the cradle of the
Rice-soul (or “Rice-baby”). I examined it, however, and found that as yet it only
contained the following objects:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1.</span> A strip of white cloth (folded up and lying at the bottom of the basket).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2.</span> Some parti-coloured thread (<i lang="ms">bĕnang panchawarna</i> or <i lang="ms">pancharona</i>).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">3.</span> A hen’s egg.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">4.</span> One of the hard jungle-nuts (candle-nuts) already referred to.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">5.</span> A cockle shell (<i lang="ms">k’rang</i>).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">6.</span> A long iron nail.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">7.</span> Five cubits of red cloth by means of which the soul-basket was to be slung round
the neck of its bearer. (The correcter custom would require an expensive cloth of
the kind called <i lang="ms">jong sarat</i>, or the “Loaded Junk,” according to my informant the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>.)</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Three new Malay skirts or <i>sarongs</i> were added, (one to each basket), and everything being ready, the various receptacles
described above were entrusted to five female bearers (<i lang="ms">Pĕnjawat</i>), who descended from the house, with the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> at their head, and set out for the rice-field. Before they had gone many yards they
were joined by the owner of the field, who walked in front of them bearing what was
called the <i lang="ms">junjongan padi</i>. This was the stem and leaves of a dark red kind of sugar-cane, which was used in
substitution for the black or “raven” variety (<i lang="ms">tĕbu gagak</i>) which, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> explained, would have been used in preference if it had been obtainable. Meanwhile
the procession passed on, and the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> repeated as we went the following prayer to the spirits:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate,
</p>
<p class="line">Peace be with thee, O Prophet ’Tap, in whose charge is the Earth,
</p>
<p class="line">I know the origin of the Rice, S’ri Gading, Gĕmala Gading,
</p>
<p class="line">That (dwelleth at) the end of the clearing, and that (dwelleth at) the beginning (top)
of the clearing;
</p>
<p class="line">That is scattered broadcast, that is cast headlong,
</p>
<p class="line">That is over-run (!) by the ants called Silambada.
</p>
<p class="line">Ho, Dang ’Pok, Dang Mĕleni,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11923src" href="#xd32e11923">212</a> (and)
</p>
<p class="line">Dang Salamat, who carriest the pole slung on thy back,
</p>
<p class="line">Gather together and press hitherwards your attendants.
</p>
<p class="line">May safety and our daily bread be granted us by God.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">On reaching the rice the procession filed through a lane already made in the rice,
until the “mother-sheaf” was reached from which the Rice-soul was to be taken. But
immediately on arriving at the spot, and before depositing the rice-baskets on the
ground, the Pawang repeated these lines:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Herons from all this region,
</p>
<p class="line">Roost ye upon the shaft of my bow;
</p>
<p class="line">Retire ye, O Spectral Reapers,
</p>
<p class="line">That we may deposit our baskets upon the ground.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here the baskets were deposited, and the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>took up her station in front of the mother-sheaf, of which mention has just been made.
</p>
<p>Covering her head with a flowing white cloth of which the ends fell upon her shoulders,
the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> now stood up facing the sheaf, and waved the ends of this cloth thrice upward to
the right, thrice upward to the left, and finally thrice upward to the right again.
Then for a few moments she stood still, close to the sheaf with her head bent forward
and buried among the ears, after which she reseated herself and dabbled the <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i> thrice upon the roots of the sheaf. One of the female bearers now planted the stem
of the sugar-cane upright in the centre of the sheaf,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11959src" href="#xd32e11959">213</a> whilst the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> sprinkled it with the <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>, and then holding the sharpened end of it over the incense, fumigated it, saying:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with thee, O Prophet ’Tap!
</p>
<p class="line">Lo, I plant this Sugar-cane
</p>
<p class="line">For you to lean against,
</p>
<p class="line">Since I am about to take away this Soul of yours, S’ri Gading,
</p>
<p class="line">And carry it home to your palace,
</p>
<p class="line">Cluck, cluck, soul! cluck, cluck, soul! cluck, cluck, soul!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> and <i lang="ms">Pĕnjawat</i> (Female Bearer), together proceeded to plant the sugar-cane in the centre of the
sheaf, and (pressing the sheaf more tightly round the sugar-cane) drew the waist of
the sheaf together and belted it with some of the outer stems of the sheaf itself;
then the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> applied the <i lang="ms">tĕpong <span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>tawar</i> once more to the sheaf, and after fumigating it in the usual manner, ran her hands
up it. Next she took in one hand (out of the brass tray) the stone and the egg, cockle-shell
and candle-nut, and with the other planted the big iron nail in the centre of the
sheaf close to the foot of the sugar-cane. Then she took in her left hand the cord
of tree-bark, and after fumigating it, together with all the vessels of rice and oil,
took up some of the rice and strewed it round about the sheaf, and then tossed the
remainder thrice upwards, some of it falling upon the rest of the company and myself.
</p>
<p>This done, she took the end of the cord in both hands, and encircling the sheaf with
it near the ground, drew it slowly upward to the waist of the sheaf, and tied it there,
after repeating what is called the “Ten Prayers” (<i lang="ms">doʿa sapuloh</i>) <i>without once taking breath</i>:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“The first, is God,
</p>
<p class="line">The second, is Muhammad,
</p>
<p class="line">The third, Holy Water of the five Hours of Prayer by Day and Night,
</p>
<p class="line">The fourth, is Pancha Indra,
</p>
<p class="line">The fifth, the Open Door of Daily Bread,
</p>
<p class="line">The sixth, the Seven Stories of the Palace-Tower,
</p>
<p class="line">The seventh, the Open Door of the Rice-sifting Platform,
</p>
<p class="line">The eighth, the Open Door of Paradise,
</p>
<p class="line">The ninth, is the Child in its Mother’s Womb,
</p>
<p class="line">The tenth, is the Child created by God, the reason of its creation being our Lord.
</p>
<p class="line">Grant this, ʿIsa!<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12048src" href="#xd32e12048">214</a>
</p>
<p class="line">Grant this, Moses!
</p>
<p class="line">Grant this, Joseph!
</p>
<p class="line">Grant this, David!
</p>
<p class="line">Grant me, from God (the opening of) all the doors of my daily bread, on earth, and
in heaven.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This prayer completed,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12058src" href="#xd32e12058">215</a> she dug up with the great <span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>toe of the left foot a small lump of soil, and picking it up, deposited it in the
centre of the sheaf.
</p>
<p>Next she took the contents of the soul-basket (the egg and stone, candle-nut and shell
as before), and after anointing them with oil and fumigating them, replaced them in
the basket; then taking the <i lang="ms">pĕnuwei sulong</i> (“Eldest Rice-cutter”), anointed the blade with the oil of frankincense, and inserting
the thumb of the right hand into her mouth, pressed it for several moments against
the roof of her palate. On withdrawing it she proceeded to cut the first seven “heads”
of rice, repeating “the Ten Prayers” as she did so. Then she put the seven “heads”
together, and <i>kissed</i> them; turned up the whites of her eyes thrice, and thrice contracting the muscles
of her throat with a sort of “click,” swallowed the water in her mouth.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12081src" href="#xd32e12081">216</a> Next she drew the small white cloth which she took from the soul-basket for the purpose
across her lap, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>laying the little bundle of seven ears in it, anointed them with oil and tied them
round with parti-coloured thread (<i lang="ms">bĕnang panchawarna</i>), after which she fumigated them with the incense, and strewing rice of each kind
over them, folded the ends of the cloth over them, and deposited them as before in
the basket, which was handed to the first bearer. Then standing up, she strewed more
rice over the sheaf, and tossing some backwards over her head, threw the remainder
over the rest of the party, saying “<i lang="ms">tabek</i>” (“pardon”) as she did so, and exclaiming “<i lang="ms">kur sĕmangat, kur sĕmangat, kur sĕmangat!</i>” (“cluck, cluck, soul!”) in a loud voice. Next she pushed the cocoa-nut shell (which
had contained the <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>) into the middle of the sheaf, and removed all traces of the lane which had been
trodden round the sheaf (to make it accessible) by bending down the surrounding ears
of rice until the gap was concealed.
</p>
<p>Then the First Bearer, slinging the basket of the Rice-child about her neck (by means
of the red cloth before referred to), took an umbrella<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12128src" href="#xd32e12128">217</a> from one of the party, and opened it to shield the Rice-child from the effects of
the sun, and when the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> had reseated herself and repeated an Arabic prayer (standing erect again at the end
of it with her hands clasped above her head), this part of the ceremony came to an
end. Moving on to another part of the field, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> now cut the next seven “heads” and deposited them in one of the three rice-baskets,
which she then handed to one of the female bearers, telling her and her two companions
to reap the field in parallel straight lines <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>facing the sun, until they had filled the three rice-baskets, after which they were
to return to the house. Leaving the three reapers at their task, I followed the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> and Eldest Bearer (the latter still shielding the Rice-child from the sun with the
umbrella) and arrived in time to witness the reception of the party as they reached
the foot of the house-ladder. Here (on the threshold) we were met by the wife of the
owner, and other women of his family, the former thrice calling out as we approached,
“<i lang="ms">Apa khabar?</i>” (“What news?”), and thrice receiving the reply, “<i lang="ms">Baik</i>” (“It is well”). On receiving this reply for the third time she threw saffron-rice
over the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> and repeated these lines:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Chop the ‘tree’ Galenggang (a kind of shrub),
</p>
<p class="line">Chop it to pieces in front of the door:
</p>
<p class="line">Yonder comes One swinging (her) arms;
</p>
<p class="line">That (methinks) is a child of mine.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To which the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> immediately replied:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Chop the young bamboo-shoots as fine as you can,
</p>
<p class="line">If you wish to stupefy the fish in the main stream.
</p>
<p class="line">In good sooth I have crossed the stream,
</p>
<p class="line">For great was my desire to come hither.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And the bearer of the Rice-child added—doubtless on the Rice-child’s behalf:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“This measure is not a measure filled with pepper,
</p>
<p class="line">But a measure filled with rice-husks.
</p>
<p class="line">My coming is not merely fortuitous,
</p>
<p class="line">But great (rather) was my desire, the wish of my heart.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">She then entered the house and laid the Rice-child (still in its basket) on a new
sleeping-mat with pillows at the head. About twenty minutes later the three <span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>Bearers returned,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12178src" href="#xd32e12178">218</a> each of their rice-baskets covered with a <i lang="ms">sarong</i>. These baskets were carried into the bedroom and deposited in order of size on the
mat at the foot of the soul-basket, the largest basket being the nearest to the soul-basket.
Finally, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> removed the <i>sarongs</i> which covered each basket and deposited them on the Rice-child’s pillow, and sticking
the “<i lang="ms">pĕnuweis</i>” into her hair, fumigated the entire row of baskets and the Rice-child, and covered
them over with the long white cloth, after which the wife of the master of the house
was told to observe certain rules of taboo for three days.

</p>
<p>The following were the taboos imposed upon her:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1.</span> Money, rice, salt, oil, tame animals, etc., were forbidden to leave the house, though
they might enter it without ill consequences.</li>

<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">5.</span> The light placed near the head of the Rice-child’s bed might not be allowed to go

for three days after the birth of a real child.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>I may add that every day, when the reapers start their reaping, they have to repeat

<p class="first">When reaping, they must cover their heads and must face the sun, no matter what hour
of the day it is, in order to prevent their own shadows from falling upon the rice
in the basket at their side.
</p>
<p><i>Pounding the first of the padi.</i>—I witnessed this ceremony three days later, at about 9 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> The three baskets filled with the first reapings were removed from the mat on which
they had been placed, and their contents emptied out upon a new mat, to each corner
of which four rice-ears were tied, and trodden out (<i lang="ms">di-irekkan</i>) by the owner of the field. Then the rice was poured back into two of the baskets,
and the straw of the rice “heads” was plaited into a wreath.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12268src" href="#xd32e12268">219</a>
</p>
<p><i>Drying the first of the padi.</i>—Preparations being complete, the two baskets full of newly-cut rice were carried
down the steps and out to an open part of the field, a little way from the house,
and there spread on a mat in the sun to dry. To spread it properly is not an easy
matter, the operator (who in this case was the owner), standing on the mat and spreading
the grains with a long sweeping motion of the hand from one side of the mat to the
other (the process being called <i lang="ms">di-kekar</i>, <i lang="ms">di-kachau</i>, or <i lang="ms">mĕmbalikkan jĕmoran</i>). In <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>the present case several objects were placed in the centre of the mat, consisting
of—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1.</span> A basket-work stand (one of those used for the cooking-pots, and called <i lang="ms">lĕkar jantan</i>).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2.</span> A bowl of water deposited upon this stand and intended “for the Rice-soul (<i lang="ms">sĕmangat padi</i>) to drink when it becomes thirsty with the heat of the sun.”</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">3.</span> A big iron nail.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">4.</span> A candle-nut (<i lang="ms">buah k’ras</i>).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">5.</span> Six trodden-out rice “heads,” a couple of which tied in a slip knot (<i lang="ms">simpul pulih</i>) are fastened to each corner of the matting.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p><i>Pounding of the rice from the three baskets.</i>—When the rice had been sufficiently dried, it was once more collected in the baskets,
and carried back to the house to be pounded.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12329src" href="#xd32e12329">220</a> That operation took place the same evening, when the rice was pounded and winnowed<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12332src" href="#xd32e12332">221</a> in the ordinary way, the only noteworthy addition being the tying of bunches of the
grass called <i lang="ms">sambau dara</i> to the upper ends of the long wooden pestles which the Malays use for the pounding
operation.
</p>
<p><i>Disposal of the empty rice-stalks from the three baskets.</i>—The chaff thus obtained was deposited in a heap by the owner of the field in a place
where three paths met, crowned with a wreath made of the empty rice-stalks, and covered
by a big stone which was intended, I was told, to keep it from being blown away.
</p>
<p>The sugar-cane was left to grow in the midst of the mother-sheaf, until the latter
should be reaped by the wife of the owner; when this takes place, it is carried back
to the house and used for next year’s reaping. Meanwhile the “heads” of the mother-sheaf
<span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>are pounded, and the grain thus obtained is mixed with the grain obtained from the
Rice-soul, and deposited in the rice-bin (<i lang="ms">kĕpok</i>) together with a stone, a lump of rosin (<i lang="ms">damar</i>), and a wreath composed of the empty rice-ears. I may add that I saw the articles
which had been deposited in the previous year in the rice-bin of the Malay at whose
house I witnessed the ceremony which I have just described.
</p>
<p>I did not witness the preliminary search for the mother-sheaf (in which the Rice-soul
was supposed to be contained), but it was described to me by the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, and performed for my benefit by the people of the house. The <i>Pawang’s</i> description ran as follows: In order to confine the “Rĕngkesa” (a Spectral Reaper)
to the boundaries, visit the four corners of the field, and at each corner tie a knot
in a rice-leaf, and hold your breath while you repeat the following charm:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“In the name of God, etc.,
</p>
<p class="line">A swallow has fallen striking the ground,
</p>
<p class="line">Striking the ground in the middle of our house-yard.
</p>
<p class="line">But ye, O Shadows and Spectral Reapers (Rĕngkesa),
</p>
<p class="line">Have your appointed place on the Boundaries (of this field).
</p>
<p class="line">By virtue of,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">These noxious spirits being thus confined to the Four Corners, you may search in safety
till you find one of the special varieties of rice-ear in which the Rice-soul resides.
</p>
<p>There are several varieties, of which the best is called <i lang="ms">Tongkat Mandah</i>; it may be described as an ordinary “rice-head” bending over to meet the tip of a
second (adventitious) “rice-head,” but it is produced only by a freak of nature. There
is some risk connected with this variety, however, for if the “Reception <span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">Sambut</i>) Ceremony” is not properly performed the owner will die. The second best is called
“The Kite” (<i lang="ms">Lang</i>). The third best is called “The Veiled Princess” (<i lang="ms">Pŭtri Bĕrtudong</i>); in this case the sheath of the “head” is of unusual length, and overshadows the
“head” itself. A fourth kind is called <i lang="ms">Padi Bĕrtel’kum</i>, and is described as a “Female Rice” (<i lang="ms">padi bĕtina</i>); like the “Veiled Princess,” it has an unusually well-developed sheath; whilst a
fifth kind is the “<i lang="ms">Padi Mendhara</i>”—a rice-plant whose leaves show white lines or markings.
</p>
<p><i>How women should reap on ordinary occasions.</i>—Whenever women go out to reap they should repeat certain charms before leaving the
house,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12398src" href="#xd32e12398">222</a> and again before depositing their baskets on the ground. Their heads should be covered,
and they should always be careful to reap, as has been said, facing the sun, <i>to prevent their shadow from falling upon the rice in the basket at their side</i>. Occasionally, however, the body is uncovered, and I was even told of one, Inche
Fatimah of Jugra, in Selangor, who when reaping stripped herself bare from the waist
upwards, and when asked why she did so said it was “to make the rice-husks thinner,
as she was tired of pounding thick-husked rice.”
</p>
<p>The sheaf which is left standing after the taking home of the Rice-soul is called
the Mother of the Rice-soul (<i lang="ms">Ibu Sĕmangat Padi</i>), and treated as a newly-made mother; that is to say, young shoots of trees (<i lang="ms">putik-putik kayu</i>) are taken, pounded together <span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">di-tumbok</i>), and scattered broadcast (<i lang="ms">di-tabor</i>) every evening for three successive days.
</p>
<p>When the three days are up you take cocoa-nut pulp (<i lang="ms">isi niyor</i>) and what are called “goat flowers” (<i lang="ms">bunga kambing</i>), mix them, and eat them with a little sugar, spitting some of the mixture out among
the rice. [So, after a birth (as the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> informed me), the young shoots of the jack-fruit (<i lang="ms">kababal nangka</i>), the rose-apple (<i lang="ms">jambu</i>), and certain kinds of banana (such as <i lang="ms">pisang abu</i> and <i lang="ms">pisang Bĕnggala</i>), and the thin pulp of young cocoa-nuts (<i lang="ms">kĕlongkong niyor</i>) are mixed with dried fish, salt, acid (<i lang="ms">asam</i>), prawn-condiment (<i lang="ms">b’lachan</i>), and similar ingredients, to form a species of salad (<i lang="ms">rojak</i>). For three successive days this salad is administered to mother and child, the person
who administers it saying, if the child be a girl, “Your mother is here, eat this
salad,” and if the child be a boy, “Your father is here, eat this salad.”]
</p>
<p>Invariably, too, when you enter the rice-clearing (<i lang="ms">mĕnĕmpoh ladang</i>) you must kiss the rice-stalks (<i lang="ms">chium tangkei padi</i>), saying, “Cluck, cluck, soul of my child!” (<i lang="ms">kur, sĕmangat anak aku!</i>) <i>just as if you were kissing an infant of your own</i>.
</p>
<p>The last sheaf (as I think I have said) is reaped by the wife of the owner, who carries
it back to the house (where it is threshed out and mixed with the Rice-soul). The
owner then takes the Rice-soul and its basket and deposits it in the big circular
rice-bin used by the Malays, together with the product of the last sheaf. Some of
the product of the first seven “heads” will be mixed with next year’s seed, and the
rest will be mixed with next year’s <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12479src" href="#xd32e12479">223</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Western States of the Peninsula by far the most important branch of industry
has for many years been that of Tin-mining. Though something like 90 per cent of the
labourers employed in the mines are Chinese, the ceremonies used at the opening of
tin-mines are purely Malay in character.
</p>
<p>The post of mining wizard, once a highly lucrative one, was in past days almost always
filled by a Malay, though occasionally the services of a Jungle-man (<i lang="ms">Sakai</i>) would be preferred. These mining wizards enjoyed in their palmy days an extraordinary
reputation, some of them being credited with the power of bringing ore to a place
where it was known that no ore existed; some, too, were believed to possess the power
of sterilising such ore as existed, and of turning it into mere grains of sand.
</p>
<p>The ore itself is regarded as endued not only with vitality, but also with the power
of growth, ore of indifferent quality being regarded as too young (<i lang="ms">muda</i>), but as likely to improve with age. Sometimes, again, it is described as resembling
a buffalo, in which shape it is believed to make its way from place to place underground.
This idea, however, is probably based upon traditions of a lode, though it is quite
in keeping <span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>with Malay ideas about the spirits residing in other minerals, the Gold spirit being
supposed to take the shape of a <i lang="ms">kijang</i> or roe-deer (whence the tradition of a golden roe-deer being found at Raub in Pahang).
</p>
<p>In connection with the subject of tin-mining the account contributed<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12524src" href="#xd32e12524">224</a> in 1885 by Mr. Abraham Hale (then Inspector of Mines in the Kinta district of Perak)
to the <i>Journal of the Straits Asiatic Society</i> is of such value as to necessitate its being quoted <i lang="la">in extenso</i>. It will be followed by such notes upon mining invocations as I was able to collect
in Selangor, after which a few remarks upon the Malay theory of animism in minerals
generally will bring the subject to a conclusion.
</p>
<p>To commence with Mr. Hale’s account:—“The valley of the Kinta is, and has been for
a very long time, essentially a mining country. There are in the district nearly five
hundred registered mines, of which three are worked by European Companies, the rest
being either private mines, <i>i.e.</i> mines claimed by Malays, which have been worked by them and their ancestors for an
indefinite period, or new mines, in other words new concessions given indifferently
on application to Malays and Chinese. There are about three hundred and fifty private
Malay mines, and it is with these principally that the following paper will deal.
</p>
<p>“So far, no lodes have been discovered in Kinta; it is, however, probable that, as
the country is opened up and prospectors get up amongst the spurs of the main range,
the sources of the stream tin will come to light.
</p>
<p>“Mining in Kinta, like mining in Lârut, is for stream tin, and this is found literally
everywhere in <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>Kinta; it is washed out of the sand in the river-beds—a very favourite employment
with Mandheling women; Kinta natives do not affect it much, although there is more
than one stream where a good worker can earn a dollar per day; it is mined for in
the valley, and sluiced for on the sides of hills; and, lastly, a very suggestive
fact to a geologist, it has been found on the tops of isolated limestone bluffs and
in the caves<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12544src" href="#xd32e12544">225</a> which some of them contain.
</p>
<p>“This stream tin has probably been worked for several centuries in Kinta; local tradition
says that a very long time ago Siamese were the principal miners, and there is evidence
that very extensive work has been done here by somebody at a time when the method
was different from that which is commonly adopted by Kinta Malays at the present day.
There are at least fifty deep well-like pits on the Lahat hill, averaging about eight
feet in diameter and perhaps twenty feet deep.
</p>
<p>“Further up country I have seen a large pit which the natives called a Siamese mine;
this is about fifty feet in diameter and over twenty feet deep, and its age may be
conjectured from the virgin forest in which it is situated. Besides these, at many
places extensive workings are continually brought to light as the country is opened
up, and these appear to have been left undisturbed for at least a hundred years. Further
evidence of old work is furnished by slabs of tin of a shape unlike that which has
been used in Perak in the memory of living persons; and only a few weeks ago two very
perfect ‘curry stones’ of an unusual shape and particularly sharp grit were found
at a depth of <span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>eight feet in natural drift. These may, perhaps, have been used to grind grain.
</p>
<p>“So peculiarly is Kinta a mining district, that even the Sakais of the hills do a
little mining to get some tin sand wherewith to buy the choppers and <i>sarongs</i> which the Malays sell to them at an exorbitant price.
</p>
<p>“The Malay <i lang="ms">pawang</i>, or medicine-man, is probably the inheritor of various remnants and traditions of
the religion which preceded Muhammadanism, and in the olden time this class of persons
derived a very fair revenue from the exercise of their profession, in propitiating
and scaring those spirits who have to do with mines and miners; even now, although
the Malay <i lang="ms">pawang</i> may squeeze a hundred or perhaps two hundred dollars out of the Chinese <i lang="ms">towkay</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12568src" href="#xd32e12568">226</a> who comes to mine for tin in Malaya, the money is not perhaps badly invested, for
the Chinaman is no prospector, whereas a good Malay <i lang="ms">pawang</i> has a wonderful ‘nose’ for tin, and it may be assumed that the Chinese <i lang="ms">towkay</i> and, before his time, the Malay miner, would not pay a tax to the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> unless they had some ground for believing that, by employing him and working under
his advice, there would be more chance of success than if they worked only on their
own responsibility.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">pawang</i> being a person who claims to have powers of divination and other imperfectly understood
attributes, endeavours to shroud his whole profession in more or less of mystery.
In his vocabulary, as in that of the gutta-hunters, special terms are used to signify
particular objects, the use of the ordinary words being dropped; this is called ‘<i lang="ms">bahâsa pantang</i>.’<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12598src" href="#xd32e12598">227</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The following are some of the special terms alluded to:—
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Ber-olak tinggi</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12608src" href="#xd32e12608">228</a> instead of <i lang="ms">gajah</i>—elephant. The elephant is not allowed on the mine, or must not be brought on to the
actual works, for fear of damage to the numerous races and dams; to name him, therefore,
would displease the spirits (<i lang="ms">hantu</i>).
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Ber-olak dâpor</i>, instead of <i lang="ms">kuching</i>—cat. Cats are not allowed on mines, nor may the name be mentioned.
</p>
<p>“A tiger of enormous size called <i lang="ms">Ber-olak</i> is said to haunt Kinta. The legend about him is as follows:— A long time ago, in
the pre-Muhammadan days, a man caught a tiger kitten and took it home; it grew up
quite tame and lived with the man until he died, when it returned to the jungle and
grew to an enormous size, nine cubits (<i lang="ms">hasta</i>) long; it is still there, though nobody ever sees it; it does no harm, but sometimes
very large tracks are seen, and men hear its roar, which is so loud that it can be
heard from Chĕmor to Bâtu Gajah; when heard in the dry season, it is a sure prognostication
of rain in fifteen days’ time.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Sial</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12643src" href="#xd32e12643">229</a> instead of <i lang="ms">kerbau</i>—water-buffalo. The buffalo is not allowed on the mine for the same reason as the
elephant.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Salah nama</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12656src" href="#xd32e12656">230</a> instead of <i lang="ms">limau nipis</i>—lime (fruit). If limes are brought on to a mine, the <i lang="ms">hantu</i> (spirits) are said to be offended; the particular feature of the fruit, which is
distasteful, appears to be its acidity. It <span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>is peculiar that Chinese have this superstition concerning limes as well as Malays;
not very long ago a Chinese <i lang="ms">towkay</i> of a mine complained that the men of a rival <i lang="ms">kongsi</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12678src" href="#xd32e12678">231</a> had brought limes and squeezed the juice into his head race, and, furthermore, had
rubbed their bodies with the juice mixed with water out of his head race, and he said
they had committed a very grave offence, and asked that they might be punished for
it.
</p>
<p>“With Malays this appears to be one of the most important <i lang="ms">pantang</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12689src" href="#xd32e12689">232</a> rules, and to such a length is it carried that <i lang="ms">bĕlachan</i> (shrimp-paste) is not allowed to be brought on to a mine for fear it should induce
people to bring limes as well, lime-juice being a necessary adjunct to <i lang="ms">bĕlachan</i> when prepared for eating.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Buah rumput</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12707src" href="#xd32e12707">233</a> or <i lang="ms">bunga rumput</i>, instead of <i lang="ms">biji</i>—tin sand.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Akar</i>, or <i lang="ms">akar hidop</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12729src" href="#xd32e12729">234</a> instead of <i lang="ms">ular</i>—snake.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Kunyit</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12743src" href="#xd32e12743">235</a> instead of <i lang="ms">lipan</i>—centipede.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Batu puteh</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12756src" href="#xd32e12756">236</a> instead of <i lang="ms">timah</i>—metallic tin.
</p>
<p>“It was important that the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> should be a marked man as to personal appearance; for this reason there are certain
positions of the body which may be assumed by him only when on the mine. These attitudes
are—first, standing with the hands clasped behind the back; and, secondly, with the
hands resting on the hips. This second position is assumed when he is engaged in ‘invocating’
the ‘spirits’ of a mine; the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> takes his station in front of the <i lang="ms">genggulang</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12775src" href="#xd32e12775">237</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>having a long piece of white cloth in his right hand, which he waves backwards and
forwards over his shoulder three times, each time calling the special <i lang="ms">hantu</i> whom he wishes to propitiate, by name; whilst engaged in this invocation his left
hand rests on his hip. During the performance of any professional duty he is also
invariably dressed in a black coat; this nobody but the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> is allowed to wear on a mine. These attitudes and the black coat comprise what is
technically termed the <i lang="ms">pakei pawang</i>.
</p>
<p>“The professional duty of the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> of a mine consists in carrying out certain ceremonies, for which he is entitled to
collect the customary fees, and in enforcing certain rules for the breach of which
he levies the customary fines.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12801src" href="#xd32e12801">238</a>
</p>
<p>“At the time of the opening of a mine he has to erect a <i lang="ms">genggulang</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12850src" href="#xd32e12850">239</a> and to call upon the tutelary <span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span><i lang="ms">hantu</i> of the locality to assist in the enterprise. The fee for this is one bag (<i lang="ms">karong</i>) of tin sand.
</p>
<p>“At the request of the miners, instead of a <i lang="ms">genggulang a kapala nasi</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12864src" href="#xd32e12864">240</a> may be erected, as cheaper and more expeditious. The fee is one <i lang="ms">gantang</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12878src" href="#xd32e12878">241</a> of tin sand.
</p>
<p>“He also assists in the ceremony of hanging the <i lang="ms">ancha</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12887src" href="#xd32e12887">242</a> in the smelting-house; his principal associate in this is the <i lang="ms">Panglima Klian</i>, who draws the <i lang="ms">ancha</i> up to its proper position close under the <i lang="ms">attaps</i>.
</p>
<p>“1. Raw cotton must not be brought on to a mine in any shape, either in its native
state or as stuffing of bolsters or mattresses. The fine (<i lang="ms">hukum pawang</i>) is $12.50; the ordinary pillow used by a miner is made of some soft wood.
</p>
<p>“2. Black coats and the attitudes designated <i lang="ms">pakei pawang</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e12914src" href="#xd32e12914">243</a> may not be assumed by any one on the mine, with the exception of the <i lang="ms">pawang</i>. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, $12.50.)
</p>
<p>“3. The gourd used as a water vessel by Malays, all descriptions of earthenware, glass,
and all sorts of limes and lemons, and the outer husk of the cocoa-nut, are prohibited
articles on mines. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, $12.50.)
</p>
<p>“<i>Note.</i>—All eating- and drinking-vessels should be made of cocoa-nut shell or of wood: the
noise made by earthenware and glass is said to be offensive to the <i lang="ms">hantu</i>. But in the case of a breach of this regulation the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> would warn the offenders two or three times before he claimed the fine.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span></p>
<p>“4. Gambling and quarrelling are strictly forbidden on mines; the fine is claimed
for the first offence. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, $12.50.)
</p>
<p>“5. Wooden aqueducts (<i lang="ms">palong</i>) must be prepared in the jungle a long way from the mine. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, $12.50.)
</p>
<p>“The noise of the chopping is said to be offensive to the <i lang="ms">hantu</i>.
</p>
<p>“6. Any breach of the <i lang="ms">bahasa pantang</i> is an offence. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, $12.50.)
</p>
<p>“7. Charcoal must not be allowed to fall into the races. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, $12.50.)
</p>
<p>“8. A miner must not wear and go to work on the mine in another man’s trousers. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, one <i lang="ms">karong</i> of tin sand.)
</p>
<p>“<i>Note.</i>—This applies only to the <i lang="ms">sĕnar sĕluar basah</i>, or working dress. It is also an offence to work in the garment called <i lang="ms">sarong</i>.
</p>
<p>“9. If the <i lang="ms">chupak</i> (measure) of the mine is broken, it must be renewed within three days. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, one <i lang="ms">bhara</i> of tin.)
</p>
<p>“10. No weapon may be brought within the four posts of the smelting-house which immediately
surround the furnace. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, $1.25.)
</p>
<p>“11. Coats may not be worn within this space. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, $1.25.)
</p>
<p>“12. These posts may not be cut or hacked. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, one slab of tin.)
</p>
<p>“13. If a miner returns from work, <i>bringing back with him some tin sand</i>, and discovers that somebody has eaten the cold rice which he had left at home, he
may claim from the delinquent one <i lang="ms">karong</i> of tin sand. The <i lang="ms">pawang</i> adjudicates in the matter.
</p>
<p>“14. An earthenware pot (<i lang="ms">priok</i>) which is broken <span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>must be replaced within three days. (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, one <i lang="ms">karong</i> of tin sand.)
</p>
<p>“15. No one may cross a race in which a miner is sluicing without going some distance
<i>above</i> him, up stream; if he does he incurs a penalty of as much tin sand as the race contains
at the moment, payable to the owner of the race. The <i lang="ms">pawang</i> adjudicates.
</p>
<p>“16. A <i lang="ms">kris</i>, or spear, at a mine, if without a sheath, must be carefully wrapped in leaves, even
the metal setting (<i lang="ms">simpei</i>) must be hidden. Spears may only be carried at the “trail.” (<i lang="ms">Hukum pawang</i>, uncertain.)
</p>
<p>“17. On the death of any miner, each of his comrades on that mine pays to the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> one <i lang="ms">chupak</i> (<i lang="ms">penjuru</i>) of tin sand.
</p>
<p>“It will be noticed that the amount of the majority of these fines is $12.50; this
is half of the amount of the fine which, under the Malay customary law, a chief could
impose on a <i lang="ms">raʿiyat</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13074src" href="#xd32e13074">244</a> for minor offences. It is also the amount of the customary dowry in the case of a
marriage with a slave or with the widow or divorced wife of a <i lang="ms">raʿiyat</i>.
</p>
<p>“The Malay miner has peculiar ideas about tin and its properties; in the first instance,
he believes that it is under the protection and command of certain spirits whom he
considers it necessary to propitiate; next he considers that the tin itself is alive
and has many of the properties of living matter, that of its own volition it can move
from place to place, that it can reproduce itself, and that it has special likes—or
perhaps affinities—for certain people and things, and <i>vice versa</i>. Hence it is advisable to treat tin-ore with a certain amount of respect, to consult
its convenience, and what is, perhaps, <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>more curious, to conduct the business of mining in such a way that the tin-ore may,
as it were, be obtained without its own knowledge!”
</p>
<p>Mr. Hale adds an interesting vocabulary of Malay mining terms from which the following
words are extracted as being specially connected with the superstitions of the miners:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i lang="ms">Ancha.</i>—A square frame 1′ 6″ × 1′ 6″, composed of strips of split bamboo for the floor and
four pieces of peeled wood for the sides. The proper wood is <i lang="ms">kayu sungkei</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13098src" href="#xd32e13098">245</a> because it has flat even twigs and leaves which lie flat and symmetrically; these
must be bound together with a creeper: rattan may not be used; it is hung to the <i lang="ms">tulang bumbong</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13111src" href="#xd32e13111">246</a> just under the <i lang="ms">attaps</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13116src" href="#xd32e13116">247</a> of the smelting-shed; it is used as an altar, the offerings made by the miners to
the spirits being placed on it.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Genggulang</i>.—The platform or altar erected by the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> at the opening of a mine. It should be built entirely of <i lang="ms">kayu sungkei</i>. The wood is peeled, except the four branches which serve as posts; these are only
peeled up to the twigs and leaves, which are left on, about 4 feet 6 inches from the
ground. At 3 feet 3 inches from the ground a square platform of round peeled sticks,
about 1 foot 3 inches each way, is arranged; one foot above the level of the platform
a sort of railing is fixed round three sides of the square, and from the open side
a ladder with four steps reaches down to the ground; the railing is carried down to
the ground on each side of the ladder, and supports a fringe of cocoa-nut leaves (<i lang="ms">jari-lipan</i>). The whole erection must be tied together with creepers; rattan must not be used.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Jari lipan.</i>—A fringe made of the young white leaflets of the cocoa-nut palm plaited together.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13136src" href="#xd32e13136">248</a>
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Jampi.</i>—The incantation of the <i lang="ms">pawang</i>.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Kapala nasi.</i>—A stake of peeled wood (<i lang="ms">kayu sungkei</i>) stuck in the ground; the top of this is split into four so as to support <span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>a platform similar to that of the <i lang="ms">genggulang</i>. Offerings are made upon it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13160src" href="#xd32e13160">249</a>
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Pantang burok mata.</i>—The period of mourning observed when a death occurs at a mine.
</p>
<p>Mourning consists in abstention from work (in the case of a neighbour or comrade)
for three days, or, in the case of the death of the <i lang="ms">pawang</i>, <i lang="ms">penghulu kelian</i>, or the feudal chief, for seven days. The expression is derived from the supposition
that in three days the eyes of a corpse have quite disappeared. Chinese miners have
a similar custom; whoever goes to assist in the burial of a corpse must not only abstain
from work, but must not go near the mine or smelting furnace for three days.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13177src" href="#xd32e13177">250</a>
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Perasap.</i>—Half a cocoa-nut shell, a cup, or any other vessel, in which votive offerings of
sweet-smelling woods and gums are burnt.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Sangka.</i>—A receptacle in which to burn offerings of sweet woods and gums; it is made of a
stick of bamboo about three feet long, one end being split and opened out to receive
the charcoal; it is stuck in the ground near races and heaps of tin sand.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13190src" href="#xd32e13190">251</a>
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Tatin gulang.</i>—The <i>pawang’s</i> fee for the ceremony of erecting a <i lang="ms">genggulang</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13209src" href="#xd32e13209">252</a></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The following notes on tin-mining in Selangor were contributed to the <i>Selangor Journal</i> by Mr. J.&nbsp;C. Pasqual, a well-known local miner:—
</p>
<p>“The Malay mining <i lang="ms">pawang</i> will soon be a thing of the past, and many a <i lang="ms">pawang</i> has returned to tilling the soil in place of his less legitimate occupation of imposing
upon the credulity of the miners. The reason for this is not far to seek, as the Malay
miner, <span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>as well as the Chinese miner, of the old school, with their thousand-and-one superstitions,
has given place to a more modern and matter-of-fact race, who place more reliance
for prospecting purposes on boring tools than on the divination and <i lang="ms">jampi</i> of the <i lang="ms">pawang</i>. But the profession of the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> has not altogether died out, as he is sometimes called into requisition for the purpose
of casting out evil spirits from the mines; of converting <i lang="ms">amang</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13241src" href="#xd32e13241">253</a> (pyrites) into tin-ore, and of invoking the spirits of a mine previous to the breaking
of the first sod in a new venture. These ceremonies generally involve the slaying
of a buffalo, a goat, or fowls, and the offering of betel-leaf, incense, and rice,
according to the means of the <i lang="ms">towkay lombong</i>.
</p>
<p>“The term <i lang="ms">pawang</i> is now used by the Chinese to indicate the ‘smelter’ (Chinese) of a mine (probably
from the fact that this office was formerly the monopoly of the Malay <i lang="ms">pawang</i>).
</p>
<p>“To the <i>pawangs</i> are attributed extraordinary powers, for besides inducing tin-ore to continue or
become plentiful in a mine, he can cause its disappearance from a rich ‘claim’ by
the inevitable <i lang="ms">jampi</i>, this latter resource being resorted to by way of revenge in cases where the <i lang="ms">towkay lombong</i> (or <i>labor</i>) fails to carry out his pecuniary obligation towards the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> whose aid he had invoked in less prosperous times. Some of the stories told of the
prowess of <i lang="ms">pawangs</i> are very ridiculous; for instance, a native lady in Ulu Langat (for women are also
credited with the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> attributes), who was the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> of Sungei Jelok in Kajang, could command a grain of tin-ore <span class="pageNum" id="pb263">[<a href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>to crawl on the palm of her hand <i>like a live worm</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13289src" href="#xd32e13289">254</a> The failure of the Sungei Jelok mines was attributed to her displeasure on account
of an alleged breach of contract on the part of the <i lang="ms">towkay lombong</i>.
</p>
<p>“The term <i lang="ms">pawang</i> is sometimes used as a verb in the sense of ‘to prospect’ a <i lang="ms">sungei</i> or stream; thus in alluding to certain streams or mines, it is not uncommon to hear
a Malay say that they have been prospected (<i lang="ms">sudah di-pawangkan</i>) by ‘Inche’ So-and-so—meaning that the stream had been discovered and proved by a
<i lang="ms">pawang</i> prior to the opening of the mines.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13313src" href="#xd32e13313">255</a>
</p>
<p>In a later article Mr. Pasqual says: “It is believed that tin will even on rare occasions
announce its presence by a peculiar noise heard in the stillness of night, and that
some birds and insects by their chirrupings and whirrings will proclaim its whereabouts.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13319src" href="#xd32e13319">256</a>
</p>
<p>In a still later article, after briefly referring to the use of the <i lang="ms">bhasa pantang</i>, or “Taboo Language,” by tin-miners in Selangor, Mr. Pasqual proceeds:—
</p>
<p>“There are, again, certain acts which are forbidden. In the mine, especially if the
<i lang="ms">karang</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13332src" href="#xd32e13332">257</a> has not yet been removed, it is forbidden to wear shoes or carry an umbrella. This
rule, it seems, originated with the coolies themselves, who in olden times insisted
that the <i lang="ms">Towkay Labur</i> should take off his shoes and close his umbrella whenever he visited the mine, so
that, as they alleged, the spirits might not be offended. But their real object was
not to allow him to pry too much into <span class="pageNum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>the mine, in case it might not bear scrutiny; and thus, by depriving him of the protection
from the sun and from the rough mining quartz which would have been afforded by the
umbrella and shoes, they prevented him from going about here, there, and everywhere,
and making unpleasant inquiries, as he would otherwise have liked to do.
</p>
<p>“Quarrelling and fighting in the mine is strictly forbidden, as it has a tendency
to drive away the ore.
</p>
<p>“Bathing in the mine is not allowed.
</p>
<p>“A man must not work in the mine with only his bathing-cloth around his body. He must
wear trousers.
</p>
<p>“If a man takes off his sun hat and puts it on the ground, he must turn it over and
let it rest upon its crown.
</p>
<p>“Limes cannot be brought into the mine. This superstition is peculiar to the Malay
miner, who has a special dread of this fruit, which, in <i lang="ms">pantang</i> language, he calls <i lang="ms">salah nama</i> (lit. ‘wrong name’) instead of <i lang="ms">limau nipis</i>.
</p>
<p>“In looking at the check-roll it is forbidden to point at the names with the finger.
No one may examine the check-roll at night with an open light, owing more probably
to the fear of setting it on fire than to superstitious prejudices.
</p>
<p>“It is considered unlucky for a man to fall off the mining ladder, for, whether he
is hurt or not, he is likely to die within the year.
</p>
<p>“An outbreak of fire in the mine is considered an omen of prosperity. Several mines
have been known to double or treble their output of tin after the occurrence of a
fire.
</p>
<p>“It is unlucky for a coolie to die in the <i lang="ms">kongsi</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>house. When, therefore, a man is very sick and past all hopes of recovery, it is customary
to put him out of the house in an extempore hut erected in the scrub, so that death
may not take place in the <i lang="ms">kongsi</i> amongst the living. His <i lang="ms">chuleis</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13372src" href="#xd32e13372">258</a> attend him during his last hours and bury him when dead. These and other superstitious
ideas and observances are, however, fast dying out, though it would still be an unsafe
experiment to enter a mine with shoes on and an umbrella over your head.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13376src" href="#xd32e13376">259</a>
</p>
<p>The remaining notes on mining ceremonies and charms were collected by me in Selangor.
On reaching the tin-bearing stratum, the tin-ore is addressed by name:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, O Tin-Ore,
</p>
<p class="line">At the first it was dew that turned into water,
</p>
<p class="line">And water that turned into foam,
</p>
<p class="line">And foam that turned into rock,
</p>
<p class="line">And rock that turned into tin-ore;
</p>
<p class="line">Do you, O Tin-Ore, lying in a matrix of solid rock,
</p>
<p class="line">Come forth from this matrix of solid rock;
</p>
<p class="line">If you do not come forth
</p>
<p class="line">You shall be a rebel in the sight of God.
</p>
<p class="line">Ho, Tin-Ore, Sir ‘Floating Islet,’
</p>
<p class="line">‘Flotsam-at-sea,’ and ‘Flotsam-on-land,’
</p>
<p class="line">Do you float up to the surface of this my tank,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13396src" href="#xd32e13396">260</a>
</p>
<p class="line">Or you shall be a rebel to God,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Sometimes each grain of ore appears to be considered as endowed with a separate entity
or individuality. Thus we find in another invocation the following passage, where
the wizard is addressing the grains of ore:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Do You (Grains of Ore) that are on the Hills descend to the Plains,
</p>
<p class="line">You that are at the Head-waters descend to Mid-stream,
</p>
<p class="line">You that are at the Estuary ascend to Mid-stream.
</p>
<p class="line">And <i>assemble yourselves together</i> in this spot.
<hr class="tb">
</p>
<p class="line">Assemble yourselves together, ‘Rice-grains’ and ‘Spinach-seed,’
</p>
<p class="line">‘Tobacco-seed,’ ‘Millet,’ and ‘Wild Ginger-Seed,’
</p>
<p class="line">Assemble ye together in this spot.
</p>
<p class="line">I am desirous of excavating this spot,
</p>
<p class="line">And of making a mine here;
</p>
<p class="line">If ye do not assemble yourselves together
</p>
<p class="line">I shall curse you;
</p>
<p class="line">You shall be turned into dust, and turned into air,
</p>
<p class="line">And you shall also be turned into water.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The separate personality of each individual grain is remarkably clear in the above
passage. The names of the different kinds of seed are in allusion to the various shapes
and sizes of the grains of ore.
</p>
<p>Yet in the very same charm various kinds of lizards and centipedes are begged to “bring
the tin-ore with them, some of them a grain or two, some of them a fistful or two,
some of them a gallon or two, some of them a load or two,” and so on. No doubt the
wizard was determined to allow the grains no loophole for escape.
</p>
<p>The objects of the charms employed by the mining wizards are the following:—
</p>
<p>(1) To clear the jungle of evil spirits (and propitiate the good ones?) before starting
to fell, as is shown by the following passage:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O Grandfather King Solomon, Black King Solomon,
</p>
<p class="line">I desire to fell these woods,
</p>
<p class="line">But it is not I who am in charge of these woods,
</p>
<p class="line">It is Yellow King Solomon who is in charge of them,
</p>
<p class="line">And Red King Solomon who is in charge of them.
</p>
<p class="line">It is I who fell the jungle,
</p>
<p class="line">But only with the permission of those two persons.
</p>
<p class="line">Rise, rise, O Ye who watch it (the tin?),
<span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">[Here are] three ‘chews’ of betel for you, and three cigarettes,
</p>
<p class="line">O Maimurup, O Maimerah, O Gadek Hitam,
</p>
<p class="line">Si Gadek Hitam (Black Grannie) from Down-stream,
</p>
<p class="line">Si Gadek Kuning (Yellow Grannie) from Up-stream,
</p>
<p class="line">And Si Maimerah from Mid-stream.”]</p>
</div>
<p class="first">(Here some lines follow which are as yet untranslatable.)
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Retire ye and avaunt from hence,
</p>
<p class="line">If ye retire not from hence,

<p class="line">Moreover, your tongue shall be slit with a bamboo splinter,

<p class="line">For thus was it sworn by ‘Grandfather Sakernanaininaini’<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13495src" href="#xd32e13495">263</a>
</p>
<p class="line">Into the leaf (of the) Putajaya,
</p>
<p class="line">Upon the summit of the mountain of Ceylon.
<hr class="tb">
</p>
<p class="line">I know the origin from which you spring,
</p>
<p class="line">From the Black Blood and the Red,

<p class="line">That was your origin.

<p class="line">We are two sons of one father, but with different inheritances;
</p>
<p class="line">In my charge is Gold and Tin-ore,
</p>
<p class="line">In yours are Rocks and Sand,
</p>
<p class="line">With chaff and bran.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">(2) To clear evil spirits away from the ground before commencing the work of excavation.
The charm for this is given in the Appendix, but is little more than a list of names.
</p>
<p>(3) To propitiate the local spirits and induce the tin-ore to show itself, when the
tin-bearing stratum is reached, by means of the charm quoted above.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>(4) To induce the spirits to partake of a banquet which is spread for them in a receptacle
intended to be the model of a royal audience-chamber.
</p>
<p>This, the “spirits’ audience-chamber” (as it is called), is usually from two to three
feet square, and is filled with offerings similar in character to those usually deposited
on the sacrificial tray (<i lang="ms">anchak</i>), with the addition, however, of certain articles which are considered to be specially
representative of the miners’ food. These articles are sugar-cane, plantains, yams,
sweet potatoes, and fish, etc.; all of which should be placed together with the customary
offerings in the “spirits’ audience-chamber.” Outside the “audience-hall,” at each
of the two front corners, should be placed a red and a white flag and a wax taper;
and at each of the two back corners should be placed a taper, making in all four flags
and seven tapers.
</p>
<p>A standard censer (<i lang="ms">pĕrasapan</i>) must be erected in front of the “audience-chamber,” and a second small censer must
also be obtained, so that burning incense may be “waved” to and fro underneath the
floor of the audience-chamber in order to fumigate it before the offerings are deposited
inside it.
</p>
<p>During the fumigation a charm is recited, in which the assistance of the spirits of
certain canonized Muhammadan worthies is invoked, concluding thus:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, O White Sheikh, wizard of the virgin jungle,
</p>
<p class="line">Wizards old, and wizards young,
</p>
<p class="line">Come hither and share the banquet I have prepared for you.
</p>
<p class="line">I crave pardon for all mistakes,
</p>
<p class="line">For all shortcomings I beg pardon in every particular.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then when the tapers are all lighted and the offerings <span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>ready, a further charm is recited, which begins as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ho, White Sheikh, king of the virgin jungle,
</p>
<p class="line">It is you to whom belong all people of the jungle and virgin forest,
</p>
<p class="line"><i>Do you, whose back is turned towards heaven</i>,
</p>
<p class="line">Give your orders to all the Elders of the earth and Princes who are here,
</p>
<p class="line">You who here hold the position of Indra,
</p>
<p class="line">Come hither and partake of my banquet.
<hr class="tb">
</p>
<p class="line">I wish to ask for your assistance,
</p>
<p class="line">I wish to open (excavate) this mine.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13555src" href="#xd32e13555">264</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The chief taboos are the killing of any sort of living creature within the mine; to
wear a <i lang="ms">sarong</i> (Malay skirt); to bring into the mine the skin of any beast; and to wear shoes or
use an umbrella within the mine. These are some of the perpetual taboos, but no doubt
there are many others.
</p>
<p>In the case of a sacrifice, however, the white buffalo may of course be killed, not
within the mine itself, but still upon its brink; and when this is done, the head
is buried, and small portions (which must be “representative” of every part of the
carcase) should be taken and deposited in the “audience-chamber.”
</p>
<p>Among the seven days’ taboos are mentioned the killing of any living timber (within
the precincts of the mine?), lewdness, and the praising or admiring of the “grass
seed” (<i lang="ms">puji buah rumput</i>), which is the name by which the tin-ore must invariably be called within the precincts
of the mine. This last taboo is due to the use of a special mining vocabulary to which
the greatest attention was formerly paid, and which did not differ very greatly from
that used in Perak.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another account of the ceremony runs as follows; I give it word for word as I took
it down from my Malay informant:—
</p>
<p>“Take five portions of cooked and five portions of uncooked fowls, both white and
black, together with black <i lang="ms">pulut</i> rice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13579src" href="#xd32e13579">265</a> millet-seed (<i lang="ms">sĕkoi</i>), seeds of the <i lang="ms">chĕbak China</i>, etc. etc. When all is ready, burn incense, scatter the black rice with the right
hand over the bottom of a tray, <i>i.e.</i> an <i lang="ms">anchak</i> (such as is used for offerings to the spirits), fumigate and deposit the offerings
in five portions upon this layer of rice (one portion going to each corner and one
to the middle of the tray). Take black cloth, five cubits long, fumigate it, and wave
it thrice round the head with the right hand from left to right, repeating the following
invocation (<i lang="ms">sĕrapah</i>):—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O Grandfather ‘Batin’<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13602src" href="#xd32e13602">266</a> the Elder,

<p class="first">The foregoing descriptions of mining ceremonies and charms refer to tin only, but
in so far as general animistic ideas go, they might be equally well applied to other
metals, such as silver and gold.
</p>
<p>It has already been remarked that as the Tin spirit is believed to take the form of
a buffalo, so the Gold spirit is said to take the form of a golden roe-deer (<i lang="ms">kijang</i>). Of the ceremonies which the Malays believe to be essential for successful gold-mining,
not much information has yet been published. In Denys’ <i>Descriptive Dictionary</i>, however, we read the following:—
</p>
<p>“Gold is believed to be under the care and in the gift of a <i lang="ms">dewa</i>, or god, and its search is therefore unhallowed, for the miners must conciliate the
<i lang="ms">dewa</i> by prayers and offerings, and carefully abstain from pronouncing the name of God
or performing any act of worship. Any acknowledgment of the sovereignty of <i>Allah</i> offends the <i lang="ms">dewa,</i> who immediately ‘hides the <span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>gold,’ or renders it invisible. At some of the great <i lang="ms">limbongan<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13702src" href="#xd32e13702">269</a> mas</i> or gold-pits in the Malay States of the interior, any allusion to the Deity subjects
the unwitting miner to a penalty which is imposed by the <i lang="ms">Penghûlu</i>. The qualities of the gold vary greatly in the same country. The finest gold brought
to market is that of the principality of Pahang, on the eastern side of the Malay
Peninsula, which brings a higher price than even that of Australia by better than
three per cent. The gold is all obtained by washing, and the metal has never been
worked, and scarcely even traced to the original veins. It is mostly in the form of
powder or dust—the <i lang="ms">mas-urai</i> of the Malays, literally ‘loose or disintegrated gold.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13715src" href="#xd32e13715">270</a>
</p>
<p>Gold, silver, and an amalgam formed of the two, are regarded as the three most precious
metals, and of these gold is, to a very uncertain and partial extent, still sometimes
regarded as a royal prerogative.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13724src" href="#xd32e13724">271</a>
</p>
<p>Of Silver still less information has been collected than of gold. This, however, is
but natural, as silver has not yet been found in payable quantities, whereas many
gold mines exist. It is just possible, however, that silver may be worked by the Malays
on a small scale in the Siamese-Malay States, as it would be difficult on any other
hypothesis to account for the following invocation, which was given me by a Malay
of Kelantan (’Che ʿAbas):—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, O Child of the Solitary Jin Salaka (Silver),
</p>
<p class="line">I know your origin.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Your dwelling-place is the Yellow Cloud Rock;
</p>
<p class="line">The Place of your Penance the Sea of Balongan Darah;
</p>
<p class="line">The Place of your Penance is a Pond in every stream;
</p>
<p class="line">The Place of your Birth was the Bay where the Wind Dies;
</p>
<p class="line">Ho, Child of the Solitary Jin Salaka,
</p>
<p class="line">Come hither at this time, this very moment,
</p>
<p class="line">I wish to make you a propitiatory offering, to banquet you on arrack and toddy.
</p>
<p class="line">If you do not come hither at this very moment
</p>
<p class="line">You shall be a rebel unto God,
</p>
<p class="line">And a rebel unto God’s Prophet Solomon,
</p>
<p class="line"><i>For I am God’s Prophet Solomon</i>.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">No other metals, so far as I am aware, are worked to any extent in the Peninsula,
yet there is the clearest possible evidence of animistic ideas about Iron. Thus for
the Sacred Lump of Iron which forms part of the regalia of more than one of the petty
Sultans in the Peninsula, the Malays entertain the most extraordinary reverence, not
unmingled with superstitious terror.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13763src" href="#xd32e13763">272</a> It is upon this “Lump of Iron,” when placed in water, that the most solemn and binding
oath known to those who make use of it is sworn; and it is to this “Lump of Iron”
that the Malay wizard refers when he recites his category of the most terrible denunciations
that Malay magic has been able to invent.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13789src" href="#xd32e13789">273</a>
</p>
<p>It is possible that there may be, in the Malay <span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>mind at all events, some connection between the supernatural powers ascribed to this
portion of the regalia and the more general use of iron as a charm against evil spirits.
For the various forms of iron which play so conspicuous a part in Malay magic, from
the long iron nail which equally protects the new-born infant and the Rice-Soul from
the powers of evil, to the betel-nut scissors which are believed to scare the evil
spirits from the dead, are alike called the representatives (symbols or emblems) of
Iron (<i lang="ms">tanda bĕsi</i>). So, too, is the blade of the wood-knife, or cutlass, which a jungle Malay will
sometimes plant in the bed of a stream (with its edge towards the source) before he
will venture to drink of the water. So, too, is the blade of the same knife, upon
the side of which he will occasionally seat himself when he is eating alone in the
forest; both of these precautions being taken, however, as I have more than once been
told, not only to drive away evil spirits, but to “confirm” the speaker’s own soul
(<i lang="ms">mĕnĕtapkan sĕmangat</i>).
</p>
<p>Even Stone appears to be regarded as distinctly connected with ideas of animism. Thus
the stone deposited in the basket with the Rice-soul, the stone deposited in the child’s
swinging cot by way of a substitute when the child is temporarily taken out of it,
and above all the various concretions to be found from time to time both in the bodies
of animals (“Bezoar” stones) and in the stems or fruit of trees (as <i lang="ms">tabasheer</i>), are examples of this. Examples of <i lang="ms">tabasheer</i> have already been quoted (under Vegetation Charms), but a few remarks about Bezoar
stones may be of interest.
</p>
<p>The Bezoar stones known to the Peninsular Malays are usually obtained either from
monkeys or porcupines. <span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>Extraordinary magical virtues are attached to these stones, the gratings of which
are mixed with water and administered to the sick.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13816src" href="#xd32e13816">274</a>
</p>
<p>I was once asked $200 for a small stone which its owner kept in cotton-wool in a small
tin box, where it lay surrounded by grains of rice, upon which he declared that it
fed.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13825src" href="#xd32e13825">275</a> I asked him how it could be proved that it was a true Bezoar stone (which it undoubtedly
was not), and he declared that if it were placed upon an inverted tumbler and touched
with the point of a <i lang="ms">k’ris</i> (dagger) or a lime-fruit it would commence to move about. Both tests were therefore
applied in my presence, but the motion of the Bezoar stone in each case proved to
be due to the most overt trickery on the part of the owner, who by pressing on one
side of the stone (which was spherical in shape) naturally caused it to move; in fact
I was easily able to produce the same effect in the same way, as I presently showed
him, though of course he could not be brought to admit the deception.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13842src" href="#xd32e13842">276</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before I leave this portion of the subject, I may mention that magic powers are very
generally ascribed to the “celts” or “stone-age” implements which are frequently found
in the Peninsula, and are called thunderbolts (<i lang="ms">batu halilintar</i>). They are not unfrequently grated and mixed with water and drunk <span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>like the Bezoar stones, but usually they are kept merely as a touch-stone for gold.

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">1.</span> PURIFICATION BY WATER</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following description (by Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell) of the bathing ceremony, as practised
by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>Perak Malays, may be taken as typical of this subject:—
</p>
<p>“Limes are used in Perak, as we use soap, when a Malay has resolved on having a really
good “scrub.” They are cut in two and squeezed (<i lang="ms">ramas</i>) in the hand. In Penang a root called <i lang="ms">sintok</i> is usually preferred to limes. When the body is deemed sufficiently cleansed the
performer, taking his stand facing the East, spits seven times, and then counts up
seven aloud. After the word <i lang="ms">tujoh</i> (seven) he throws away the remains of the limes or <i lang="ms">sintok</i> to the West, saying aloud, <i lang="ms">Pergi-lah samua sial jambalang deripada badan aku ka pusat tasek Paujangi</i>, ‘Misfortune and spirits of evil begone from my body to the whirlpool of the lake
Paujangi!’ Then he throws (<i lang="ms">jurus</i>) a few buckets of water over himself, and the operation is complete.
</p>
<p>“The lake Paujangi is situated in mid-ocean, and its whirlpool most likely causes
the tides. All the waters of the sea and rivers are finally received there. It is
probably as eligible an abode for exorcised spirits as the Red Sea was once considered
to be by our forefathers.” <a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13965src" href="#xd32e13965">277</a>
</p>
<p>The ceremony just described is evidently a form of purification by water. Similar
purificatory ceremonies form an integral part of Malay customs at birth, adolescence,
marriage, sickness, death, and in fact at every critical period of the life of a Malay;
but will be most conveniently discussed in detail under each of the particular headings
referred to. The <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i> ceremony (for the details of which <i>see</i> <a href="#ch3">Chapter III.</a>, and which is perhaps the commonest <span class="pageNum" id="pb279">[<a href="#pb279">279</a>]</span>of all Malay magic rites) would also seem to have originated from ideas of ceremonial
purification.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="s5.3.2">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> THE SEA, RIVERS, AND STREAMS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Malays have been from time immemorial a sea-faring race, and are quite as superstitious
in their ideas of the sea as sailors in other parts of the world.
</p>
<p>As has been already indicated,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13995src" href="#xd32e13995">278</a> their animistic notions include a belief in Water Spirits, both of the sea and of
rivers, and occasionally this belief finds expression in ritual observances.
</p>
<p>Thus, for instance, it was formerly the custom to insert a number of sugar-palm twigs
(<i lang="ms">sĕgar kabong</i>) into the top of the ship’s mast, making the end of it look not unlike a small birch
of black twigs.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14009src" href="#xd32e14009">279</a>
</p>
<p>This was intended to prevent the Water Spirit (<i lang="ms">Hantu Ayer</i>) from settling on the mast. His appearance when he does settle is described as resembling
the glow of fire flies or of phosphorescence in the sea—evidently a form of St. Elmo’s
fire.
</p>
<p>The ship being a living organism, one must, of course, when all is ready, persuade
it to make a proper start. To effect this you go on board, and sitting down beside
the well (<i lang="ms">petak ruang</i>), burn incense and strew the sacrificial rice, and then tapping the inside of the
keelson (<i lang="ms">jintekkan sĕrĕmpu</i>) and the next plank above it (<i lang="ms">apit lĕmpong</i>), beg them to adhere to each other during the voyage, <i>e.g.</i>:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, O ‘big Mĕdang’ and ‘low-growing Mĕdang!’
</p>
<p class="line">Be ye not parted brother from brother,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">I desire you to speed me, to the utmost of your power,
</p>
<p class="line">To <i>such and such a place</i>;
</p>
<p class="line">If ye will not, ye shall be rebels against God,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">I need hardly explain, perhaps, that “big <i lang="ms">mĕdang</i>” and “low-growing <i lang="ms">mĕdang</i>” are the names of two varieties of the same tree, which are supposed in the present
instance to have furnished the timber from which these different parts were made.
</p>
<p>Then you stand up in the bows and call upon the Sea Spirits for their assistance in
pointing out shoals, snags, and rocky islets.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14056src" href="#xd32e14056">280</a>
</p>
<p>Sometimes a talisman is manufactured by writing an Arabic text on a leaf which is
then thrown into the sea.
</p>
<p>So, too, it is not unusual to see rocks in mid-stream near the mouths of rivers adorned
with a white cloth hanging from a long stick or pole, which marks them out as “sacred
places,” and sometimes in rapids where navigation is difficult or dangerous, offerings
are made to the River Spirits, as the following quotation will show:—
</p>
<p>“We commenced at last to slide down a long reach of troubled water perceptibly out
of the horizontal. The raft buried itself under the surface, leaving dry only our
little stage, and the whole fabric shook and trembled as if it were about to break
up. Yelling ‘<i lang="ms">Sambut, sambut</i>’ (‘Receive, receive’) to the spirits of the stream, whom Kulup Mohamed was propitiating
with small offerings of rice and leaves, the panting boatmen continued their struggles
until we shot out once more into smooth deep water, and all danger was over.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14071src" href="#xd32e14071">281</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb281">[<a href="#pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>The importance of rivers in the Malay Peninsula, and for that matter, in Malayan countries
generally, can hardly be overrated. It was by the rivers that Malay immigration, coming
for the most part, if not entirely, from Sumatra, entered the interior of the Peninsula,
and before the influx of Europeans had superseded them by roads and railways the rivers
were the sole means of inland communication. All old Malay settlements are situated
on the banks of rivers or streams, both on this account and because of the necessity
of having a plentiful supply of water for the purpose of irrigating the rice-fields,
which constitute the main source of livelihood for the inhabitants.
</p>
<p>Accordingly the backbone, so to speak, of a Malay district is the river that runs
through it, and from which in most cases the district takes its name; for here, as
elsewhere, the river-names are generally older than the names of territorial divisions.
They are often unintelligible and probably of pre-Malayan origin, but are sometimes
derived from the Malay names of forest trees. As a rule every reach and point has
a name known to the local Malays, even though the river may run through forest and
swamp with only a few villages scattered at intervals of several miles along its banks.
</p>
<p>Of river legends there are not a few. The following extract relates to one of the
largest rivers of the Peninsula, the river Perak, which gives its name to the largest
and most important of the Malay States of the West Coast. <i lang="ms">Perak</i> means silver, though none is mined in the country; and the legend is a fair specimen
of the sort of story which grows up round an attempt to account for an otherwise inexplicable
name:—
</p>
<p>“On their return down-stream, the Raja and his <span class="pageNum" id="pb282">[<a href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>followers halted at Chigar Galah, where a small stream runs into the river Perak.
They were struck with astonishment at finding the water of this stream as white as
<i lang="ms">santan</i> (the grated pulp of the cocoa-nut mixed with water). Magat Terawis, who was despatched
to the source of the stream to discover the cause of this phenomenon, found there
a large fish of the kind called <i lang="ms">haruan</i> engaged in suckling her young one. She had large white breasts from which milk issued.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14095src" href="#xd32e14095">282</a>
</p>
<p>“He returned and told the Raja, who called the river ‘Perak’ (‘silver’), in allusion
to its exceeding whiteness. Then he returned to Kota Lama.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14104src" href="#xd32e14104">283</a>

<h5 class="main"><i>The Crocodile</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the origin of the Crocodile two conflicting stories, at least, are told. One of
these was collected by Sir William Maxwell in Perak; the other was taken down by me
from a Labu Malay in Selangor, but I have not met with it elsewhere; a parallel version
of the story quoted by Maxwell being the commonest form of the legend in Selangor
as well as Perak.
</p>
<p>Sir William Maxwell’s account runs as follows:—
</p>
<p>“In the case of the crocodile, we find an instance of a dangerous animal being regarded
by Malays as possessed of mysterious powers, which distinguish <span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>him from most of the brute creation, and class him with the tiger and elephant. Just
as in some parts of India sacred crocodiles are protected and fed in tanks set apart
for them by Hindus, so in Malay rivers here and there particular crocodiles are considered
<i lang="ms">kramat</i> (sacred), and are safe from molestation. On a river in the interior of Malacca I
have had my gun-barrels knocked up when taking aim at a crocodile, the Malay who did
it immediately falling on his knees in the bottom of the boat and entreating forgiveness,
on the ground that the individual reptile aimed at was <i lang="ms">kramat</i>, and that the speaker’s family would not be safe if it were injured. The source of
ideas like this lies far deeper in the Malay mind than his Muhammadanism; but the
new creed has, in many instances, appropriated and accounted for them. The connection
of the tiger with Ali, the uncle of the prophet, has already been explained. A grosser
Muhammadan fable has been invented regarding the crocodile.
</p>
<p>“This reptile, say the Pêrak Malays, was first created in the following manner:—
</p>
<p>“There was once upon a time a woman called Putri Padang Gerinsing, whose petitions
found great favour and acceptance with the Almighty.
</p>
<p>“She it was who had the care of Siti Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet. One day
she took some clay and fashioned it into the likeness of what is now the crocodile.
The material on which she moulded the clay was a sheet of <i lang="ms">upih</i> (the sheath of the betel-nut palm). This became the covering of the crocodile’s under-surface.
When she attempted to make the mass breathe it broke in pieces. This happened twice.
Now it chanced that the Tuan Putri had just <span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>been eating sugar-cane, so she arranged a number of sugar-cane joints to serve as
a backbone, and the peelings of the rind she utilised as ribs. On its head she placed
a sharp stone, and she made eyes out of bits of saffron (<i lang="ms">kuniet</i>); the tail was made of the mid-rib and leaves of a betel-nut frond. She prayed to
God Almighty that the creature might have life, and it at once commenced to breathe
and move. For a long time it was a plaything of the Prophet’s daughter, Siti Fatima;
but it at length became treacherous and faithless to Tuan Putri Padang Gerinsing,
who had grown old and feeble. Then Fatima cursed it, saying, ‘Thou shalt be the crocodile
of the sea, no enjoyment shall be thine, and thou shalt not know lust or desire.’
She then deprived it of its teeth and tongue, and drove nails into its jaws to close
them. It is these nails which serve the crocodile as teeth to this day. Malay Pawangs
in Pêrak observe the following methods of proceeding when it is desired to hook a
crocodile:—To commence with, a white fowl must be slain in the orthodox way, by cutting
its throat, and some of its blood must be rubbed on the line (usually formed of rattan)
to which the fowl itself is attached as bait. The dying struggles of the fowl in the
water are closely watched, and conclusions are drawn from them as to the probable
behaviour of the crocodile when hooked. If the fowl goes to a considerable distance
the crocodile will most likely endeavour to make off; but it will be otherwise if
the fowl moves a little way only up and down or across the stream.
</p>
<p>“When the line is set the following spell must be repeated: ‘<i lang="ms">Aur Dangsari kamala sari, sambut kirim Tuan Putri Padang Gerinsing; tidak di-sambut
mata <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>angkau chabut</i>’ (<span class="corr" id="xd32e14149" title="Not in source">‘</span>O Dangsari, lotus-flower, receive what is sent thee by the Lady Princess Padang Gerinsing;
if thou receivest it not, may thy eyes be torn out’). As the bait is thrown into the
water the operator must blow on it three times, stroke it three times, and thrice
repeat the following sentence, with his teeth closed and without drawing breath: ‘<i lang="ms">Kun kata Allah sapaya kun kata Muhammad tab paku</i>,’ (‘<i lang="ms">Kun</i> saith God, so <i lang="ms">kun</i> saith Muhammad; nail be fixed.’) Other formulas are used during other stages of the
proceedings.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14161src" href="#xd32e14161">284</a>
</p>
<p>The rarer story, to which allusion has been made, was the following:—
</p>
<p>“There was a woman who had a child which had just learnt to sit up (<i lang="ms">tahu dudok</i>), and to which she gave the name of ‘Sarilang.’ One day she took the child to the
river-side in order to bathe it, but during the latter operation it slipped from her
grasp and fell into the river. The mother shrieked and wept, but as she did not know
how to dive she had to return home without her child. That night she dreamed a dream,
in which her child appeared and said, ‘Weep no more, mother, I have turned into a
crocodile, and am now called ‘Grandsire Sarilang’ (’Toh Sarilang): if you would meet
me, come to-morrow to the spot where you lost me.’ Next morning, therefore, the mother
repaired to the river and called upon the name of her child, whereupon her child rose
to the surface, and she saw that from the waist downwards he had already turned into
a crocodile, though he was still human down to the waist. Now the child said, ‘Come
back again after fourteen days, and remember to bring an egg and a plantain (banana).’
She therefore went <span class="pageNum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>again at the time appointed, and having called upon him by his new name (’Toh Sarilang),
he again came to the surface, when she saw that from the waist upwards he had also
now turned into a crocodile. So she gave him the egg and the plantain, and he devoured
them, and when he had done so he said, ‘Whenever the crocodiles get ferocious (<i lang="ms">ganas</i>), and commence to attack human beings, take a plantain, an egg, and a handful of
parched rice, and after scattering the rice on the river, leave the egg and the plantain
on the bank, calling upon my name (’Toh Sarilang)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14178src" href="#xd32e14178">285</a> as you do so, and their ferocity will immediately cease.’ ”
</p>
<p>The notes on crocodile folklore which will now be given were reprinted in the <i>Selangor Journal</i> from the “Perak Museum Notes” of Mr. Wray.
</p>
<p>“When the eggs of a crocodile are hatching out, the mother watches; the little ones
that take to their native element she does not molest, but she eats up all those which
run away from the water, but should any escape her and get away on to the land they
will change into tigers. Some of these reptiles are said to have tongues, and when
possessed of that organ they are very much more vicious and dangerous than the ordinarily
formed ones. When a crocodile enters a river it swallows a pebble, so that on opening
the stomach of one it is only necessary to count the stones in it to tell how many
rivers it has been into during its life. The Malays call these stones <i lang="ms">kira-kira dia</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14191src" href="#xd32e14191">286</a> on this account. The Indians on the banks of the Orinoco, on the other hand, assert
that the alligator swallows stones to add weight to its body to aid it in diving and
<span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>dragging its prey under water. Crocodiles inhabiting a river are said to resent the
intrusion of strangers from other waters, and fights often take place in consequence.
According to the Malays they are gifted with two pairs of eyes. The upper ones they
use when above water, and the under pair when beneath the surface. This latter pair
is situated half-way between the muzzle and the angle of the mouth, on the under surface
of the lower jaw. These are in reality not eyes, but inward folds of skin connected
by a duct with a scent gland, which secretes an unctuous substance of a dark gray
colour, with a strong musky odour. Medicinal properties are attributed to the flesh
of the males, which are believed to be of very rare occurrence, and to be quite unable
to leave the water by reason of their peculiar conformation. The fact is that the
sexes are almost undistinguishable, except on dissection, and therefore the natives
class all that are caught as females. While on this subject, it may be worth mentioning
that at Port Weld there used to be a tame crocodile which would come when called.
The Malays fed it regularly, and said it was not vicious, and would not do any harm.
It was repeatedly seen by the yearly visitants to Port Weld, or Sapetang, as the place
was then called, and was a fine big animal, with a bunch of seaweed growing on its
head. Some one had it called, and then fired at the poor thing; whether it was wounded
or only frightened is uncertain, but it never came again.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14198src" href="#xd32e14198">287</a>
</p>
<p>The following notes upon the same subject were collected by me in Selangor:—
</p>
<p>The female crocodile commonly builds her nest, with or without the aid of the male,
among the thorny <span class="pageNum" id="pb288">[<a href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>clumps of <i lang="ms">lĕmpiei</i> (or <i lang="ms">dĕmpiei</i>) trees just above high-water mark, using the fallen leaves to form the nest, and
breaking up the twigs with her mouth. The season for laying is said, in the north
of the Peninsula, to coincide with the time “when the rice-stalks swell with the grain,”
<i>i.e.</i> the end of the wet season.
</p>
<p>The most prolific species of crocodile is reputed to be the <i lang="ms">buaya lubok</i>, or Bight crocodile (also called <i lang="ms">buaya rawang</i>, or Marsh crocodile), which lays as many as fifty or sixty eggs in a single nest.
Other varieties, I may add, are the <i lang="ms">buaya tĕmbaga</i> (Copper crocodile), the <i lang="ms">buaya katak</i> (Dwarf crocodile), which is, as its name implies, “short and stout,” and the <i lang="ms">buaya hitam</i> or <i lang="ms">bĕsi</i> (Black or Iron crocodile), which is reported to attain a larger size than any other
variety. This latter kind is often moss-grown, and is hence called <i lang="ms">buaya bĕrlumut</i> (Mossy crocodile). The largest specimen of this variety of which I have had any reliable
account is one which measured “four fathoms, less one <i lang="ms">hasta</i>” (about 23 feet), and which was caught in the time of Sultan Mahmat at Sungei Sembilang,
near Kuala Selangor, by one Nakhoda Kutib.
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">buaya jolong-jolong</i>, which has attracted attention owing to its reputed identification with the gavial
of Indian waters, and which is therefore no true crocodile, is pointedly described
by Malays as separating itself from the other species.
</p>
<p>Finally, there is the <i lang="ms">buaya gulong tĕnun</i> (the “Crocodile that Rolls up the Weft”?), which is not, however, the name of a separate
variety, but is the name applied to the Young Person or New Woman of the world of
crocodile-folk—the aggressive female who “snaps” at everything and everybody for the
mere glory of the snap!<span id="xd32e14252"></span>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>“After hatching,” says Mr. Wray, “the mother watches, and … eats up all those which
run away from the water, but should any escape her and get away on to the land they
will turn into tigers.” There is perhaps more point in the Selangor tradition, according
to which the little runaways turn, not into tigers, but into “iguanas” (Monitor lizards).
</p>
<p>As regards the want of a tongue, which is supposed to be common to all crocodiles,
it is said they were so created by design, in order that they might not acquire too
pronounced a “taste” for human flesh. Hence the proverb which declares that no carrion
is too bad for them to welcome: “<i lang="ms">Buaya mana tahu mĕnolak bangkei?</i>” (“When will crocodiles refuse corpses?”)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14261src" href="#xd32e14261">288</a>
</p>
<p>After the outbreak of ferocity (<i lang="ms">ganas</i>) among the crocodiles in the Klang River last year, some account of the way in which
the crocodile is here said to capture and destroy his human victims may prove of interest.
</p>
<p>Every crocodile has, according to the Selangor Malay, three sets of fangs, which are
named as follows: (1) <i lang="ms">si hampa daya</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14273src" href="#xd32e14273">289</a> (two above and two below), at the tip of the jaws; (2) <i lang="ms">ĕntah-ĕntah</i> (two in the upper and two in the lower jaw), half-way up; (3) <i lang="ms">charik kapan</i> (two in the upper and two in the lower jaw), near the socket of the jaws.
</p>
<p>The first may be translated by “Exhaust your devices”; the second by “Yes or no”;
and the third by “Tear the shroud,” the latter being a reference to the selvage which,
among the Malays, is torn off the <span class="pageNum" id="pb290">[<a href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>shroud and afterwards used for tying it up when the corpse has been wrapped in it.
</p>
<p>If a man is caught by the “Exhausters of all Resources,” he has a fair chance of escape;
if caught by the “Debateable” teeth his escape is decidedly problematical; but if
caught by the “Tearers of the Shroud,” he is to all intents and purposes a dead man.
Whenever it effects a capture the crocodile carries its victim at once below the surface,
and either tries to smother him in the soft, thick mud of the mangrove swamp, or pushes
him under a snag or projecting root, with the object of letting him drown, while it
retires to watch him from a short distance. After what it considers a sufficient interval
to effect its purpose, the crocodile seizes the body of the drowned man and rises
to the surface, when it “calls upon the Sun, Moon, and Stars to bear witness” that
it was not guilty of the homicide—
</p>
<div lang="ms" class="lgouter xd32e2490">
<p class="line">“Bukan aku mĕmbunoh angkau,
</p>
<p class="line">Ayer yang mĕmbunoh angkau.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Which, being translated, means—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“It was not I who killed you,
</p>
<p class="line">It was water which killed you.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14313src" href="#xd32e14313">290</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">After thrice repeating this strange performance, the crocodile again dives and proceeds
to prepare the corpse for its prospective banquet. Embracing the corpse with its “arms,”
and curving the tip of its <span class="pageNum" id="pb291">[<a href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>powerful tail under its own belly (until the tail is nearly bent double), it contrives
to break the backbone of the victim, and then picking up the body once more with its
teeth, dashes it violently against a trunk or root in order to break the long bones
of the limbs. When the bones are thus so broken as to offer no obstruction, it swallows
the body whole—thus affording a remarkable parallel to the boa in its method of devouring
its prey, and recalling Darwinian ideas of their cousin-hood. Miraculous escapes have,
however, occasionally occurred. Thus Lebai ʿAli was caught by a crocodile at Batu
Burok (Kuala Selangor), one evening as the tide was ebbing, and the crocodile, after
smothering him effectually (as it thought) in the thick mud, retired to await the
end. Insensibly, however, it floated farther and farther off with the falling tide,
and Lebai ʿAli, seeing his opportunity, made a bold and successful dash for freedom.
</p>
<p>A similar case was that of Si Ka’, who was pushed under a bamboo root on the river
bank by the crocodile which caught him, and who, after waiting till his formidable
enemy had floated a little farther off than usual, drew himself up by an overhanging
stem and swarmed up it. At the same moment the crocodile made a rush, and actually
caught him by the great toe, which latter, however, he willingly surrendered to his
enemy as the price of his liberty.
</p>
<p>A yet more marvellous escape, was that of the youth belonging to the Government launch
at Klang, who escaped, it is related, by the time-honoured expedient of putting his
thumbs into the crocodile’s eyes. In connection with this latter exploit, by the way,
Malay authorities assert that the crocodile’s eyes protrude from their sockets on
stalks (like those <span class="pageNum" id="pb292">[<a href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>of a crab) so long as he stays under water, the stalks being “as long as the forefinger,”
so that it is quite an easy matter to catch hold of these living “pegs.”
</p>
<p>For the rest, crocodiles are said by the Malays to have a sort of false stomach divided
into several pouches or sacs, one sac being for the stones which they swallow, and
another for the clothes and accoutrements of their human victims, these pouches being
in addition to their real stomach (in which the remains of monkeys, wild pig, mouse-deer,
and other small animals are found), and, in the case of female specimens, the ovary.
The second pair of eyes in the neck which, Mr. Wray says, they are supposed to use
when below the surface, are in Selangor supposed to be used at night, whence they
are called <i lang="ms">mata malam</i>, or night-eyes, as opposed to their real eyes which they are supposed to use only
by day.
</p>
<p>As regards the stones, which crocodiles undoubtedly swallow, they are sometimes supposed
to enable each male crocodile to keep an account of the number of rivers which it
has entered, of the number of bights it has lived in, or even of the number of its
human victims. The noise which crocodiles make when fighting resembles a loud roar
or bellow, and the Malays apply the same word <i lang="ms">mĕnguak</i> to the bellow of the crocodile as well as to that of the buffalo.
</p>
<p>The wrath of the crocodile-folk is provoked by those who wish to shoot them, in various
ways, of which, perhaps, the commonest is to dabble a <i lang="ms">sarong</i>, or (as is said to be more effectual) a woman’s mosquito-curtain, in the water of
the river where they live. So also to keep two sets of weights and measures (one for
buying and another for selling, as is sometimes <span class="pageNum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>done by the Chinese), is said to be a certain means of provoking their indignation.
</p>
<p>The crocodile-wizard is sometimes credited with the power of calling the crocodile-folk
together, and of discovering a man-eater among them, and an eye-witness lately described
to me the scene on one such occasion. A Malay had been carried off and devoured by
a crocodile at Larut, and a Batu Bara man, who went by the sobriquet of Nakhoda Hassan,
undertook to discover the culprit. Sprinkling some of the usual sacrificial rice-paste
(<i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>) and “saffron” rice upon the surface of the river, he called out in loud tones to
the various tribes of crocodiles in the river, and summoned them to appear on the
surface. My informant declares that not less than eight or ten crocodiles actually
appeared, whereupon the Pawang commanded them all to return to the bottom with the
exception of the one which was guilty. In a few moments only one crocodile remained
on the surface, and this one, on being forthwith killed and cut open, was found to
contain the garments of the unfortunate man who had been captured by it. Similar stories
of the prowess of crocodile charmers are told by the Javanese.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14350src" href="#xd32e14350">291</a>
</p>
<p>I shall now proceed to describe the methods and ceremonies used for the catching of
crocodiles. The following is a description by Mr. J.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M. Robson, of Selangor, of
the most usual method, at all events in Selangor, but it would appear from remarks
upon the subject in Dr. Denys’ work, that live as well as dead bait is commonly used:—
</p>
<p>“A small piece of hard wood, about 6 in. or 8 in. long, and about three-quarters of
an inch thick, is <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>sharpened at both ends, and to the middle of this the end of a yard of twine is firmly
fastened, the twine having about a dozen strands just held together by say a couple
of knots, so as to prevent the crocodile from biting it through, as the strands simply
get between his teeth; to the other end of this twine is fastened a single uncut rattan,
at least 20 feet long, which can be only a quarter of an inch in diameter, but may
with advantage be a little bigger; a small stick affixed to the end of the line, to
act as a visible float, completes this part of the gear. Probably a crocodile will
eat anything, but he is certainly partial to chicken—at least that bait is always
successful in the Sepang river—so, having killed some sort of fowl, the body is cut
right through the breast lengthways from head to tail, and the small piece of pointed
hard wood inserted, and the bird bound up again with string. Next, two pieces of light
wood are nailed together, forming a small floating platform about a foot square, and
on this the fowl is placed, raised on miniature trestles. The small platform thus
furnished is placed in a likely spot near the bank, and the rattan line is hitched
over a small branch or a stake, so that the bait platform may not be carried away
by the tide. By the next morning the rattan line, bait and platform may all have disappeared,
which probably means that the crocodile, having swallowed the fowl, has gone off with
the rattan in tow, a tug being sufficient to set it free, whilst the platform, thus
released, has drifted away. A crocodile will try the aggressive sometimes, so, when
going in pursuit, it is better to have a boat than a <i lang="ms">sampan</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14364src" href="#xd32e14364">292</a> but Malay paddles are the most convenient in either case. It is also advisable to
have <span class="pageNum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>a second man with a rifle. The crocodile has probably a favourite place up-stream,
so the boatmen paddle up on the look-out for the rattan (which always floats), finding
it at length close to the mangrove roots bordering on the river, perhaps. The boat-hook
picks up the floating-stick end of the line, and, with a couple of boatmen on to this
and a crocodile at the other end, with the small pointed hard wood stick across his
throat, the excitement begins. The crocodile plunges about amidst the mangrove roots
under the water, and then makes a rush; the rattan is paid out again and the boat
follows; then he rushes under the boat, perhaps at the boat, whilst the line is steadily
pulled in. This sort of thing may last some time, but the only thing to be afraid
of is the rattan’s getting twisted round a <i lang="ms">bakau</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14371src" href="#xd32e14371">293</a> root under water, which might prevent a capture; otherwise, after a good deal of
playing of a rather violent nature, the continual pulling of the rattan-holders in
the boat, or his own aggressiveness, induces him to show his head above the surface,
whereat the rifles crack, and the crocodile dies, though often not till four or five
bullets have been put into different parts of his body.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14378src" href="#xd32e14378">294</a>
</p>
<p>I will now proceed to describe the religious ceremonies which accompany this performance.
</p>
<p>The following outline of the ceremonies used in catching a crocodile who is known
to be a <i>man-eater</i>, was taken down by me from the mouth of a noted crocodile-wizard on the Langat river.
First, you take strips of bark of a river-side bush or tree called <i lang="ms">baru-baru</i> (which must be cut down at a single stroke), and fasten them together at each end
only, <span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>so that they form a rope with divided (unravelled) strands. This will form that part
of your tackle which corresponds to the gut (<i lang="ms">pĕrambut</i>) of a fishing line, (<i>i.e.</i> the part just above the hook), and the advantage of it is that the loose strands
get between the crocodile’s teeth, and prevent it from being bitten through as a rope
would certainly be.
</p>
<p>Next, you take a piece of the bottommost rung of a house-ladder (<i lang="ms">anak tangga bongsu</i>), and sharpen it to a point at both ends, so as to form a cross-piece (<i lang="ms">palang</i>) such as will be likely to stick in the crocodile’s throat. Having fastened one end
of the “gut” round the middle of the cross-piece, and the other to your rattan line,
the length of which may be from ten to fifteen fathoms or so, according to the depth
of the river at the spot where the crocodile is supposed to lie, you must next cut
down a young tree to serve as the pole (<i lang="ms">chanchang</i>) to which the floating platform and bait may be subsequently attached. This pole
may be of any kind of wood except bamboo; so when you have found a suitable tree,
take hold of it with the left hand and chop at it thrice with the right, saying a
charm as you do so—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, O Prophet Tĕtap, in whose charge is the earth,
</p>
<p class="line">Peace be with you, O Prophet Noah, Planter of Trees,
</p>
<p class="line">I petition for this tree to serve as a mooring-post for my crocodile-trap;
</p>
<p class="line">If it is to kill him (the crocodile), do you fall supine,
</p>
<p class="line">If it is not to kill him, do you fall prone.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14415src" href="#xd32e14415">295</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">These last two lines refer to the omens which are taken from the way the tree falls;
the “supine” position being that of a crocodile which has “turned <span class="pageNum" id="pb297">[<a href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>turtle,” whereas the prone position would be its natural attitude as it swims.
</p>
<p>Then start making the floating platform or raft (<i lang="ms">rakit</i>) by chopping a plantain stem (any kind will do) into three lengths (<i lang="ms">di-k’ratkan tiga</i>), and then skewering these lengths together at their ends so as to form a triangle.
</p>
<p>Into the apex of this triangle firmly plant the lower end of a strong and springy
rod, making the upper end curve over slightly in a forward direction (<i lang="ms">di-pasang-nya kayu mĕlentor ka-atas</i>) and securing it in its position by two lashings, which are carried down from its
tip and fastened to the two front corners of the triangle. Then utter the charm and
plant the pole by the river-side in the spot you have selected, holding your breath
and making believe that you are King Solomon (<i lang="ms">di-sifatkan kita Raja Suleiman</i>) as it sinks into the ground. The charm consists of these lines:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, O Prophet Khailir,
</p>
<p class="line">In whose charge is the water;
</p>
<p class="line">Peace be with you, O Prophet Tĕtap,
</p>
<p class="line">In whose charge is the earth;
</p>
<p class="line">Pardon, King of the Sea, Deity of Mid-currents,
</p>
<p class="line">I ask only for the ‘guilty’ (crocodiles),
</p>
<p class="line">The innocent do you assist me to let go,
</p>
<p class="line">And drive out only the guilty which devoured <i>So-and-so</i>.
</p>
<p class="line">If you do not do so, you shall die,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Now prepare the bait. To do this you must kill a fowl (in the orthodox way), cut it
partly open and insert the ladder-rung into its body, wrapping the flesh and feathers
round it, and binding the whole bird seven times round and seven times across with
a piece of rattan, not forgetting, however, to observe silence and hold your breath
as you pass the first <span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>rattan lashing round the fowl’s carcase. When you have finished binding it up as directed,
chew some betel-leaf and eject (<i lang="ms">sĕmborkan</i>) the chewed leaf upon the fowl’s head, repeating the appropriate charm.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14461src" href="#xd32e14461">296</a> Then hook the bait (<i lang="ms">sangkutkan umpan</i>) on to the tip of the bent rod (on no account tie it on, as it must be left free
for the crocodile to swallow), and having prepared the wonted accessories—including
three chews of betel-leaf, a <i lang="ms">richek</i> of ginger (<i lang="ms">halia bara sa-richek</i>), and seven white pepper-corns (<i lang="ms">lada sulah tujoh biji</i>)—breathe (<i lang="ms">jampikan</i>) upon the betel-leaf, and at the end of the invocation eject the chewed betel-leaf
upon the head of the cock intended for the bait.
</p>
<p>The charm to be recited (which makes allusion to the fable concerning the supposed
origin of the crocodile) runs as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Follow in procession, follow in succession,
</p>
<p class="line">The ‘Assembly-flower’ begins to unfold its petals;
</p>
<p class="line">Come in procession, come in succession,
</p>
<p class="line">King Solomon’s self comes to summon you.
</p>
<p class="line">Ho, Si Jambu Rakai, I know your origin;
</p>
<p class="line">Sugar-cane knots forty-four were your bones,
</p>
<p class="line">Of clay was formed your body;
</p>
<p class="line">Rootlets of the areca-palm were your arteries,
</p>
<p class="line">Liquid sugar made your blood,
</p>
<p class="line">A rotten mat your skin,
</p>
<p class="line">And a mid-rib of the thatch-palm your tail,
</p>
<p class="line">Prickles of the pandanus made your dorsal ridge,
</p>
<p class="line">And pointed <i lang="ms">bĕrĕmbang</i> suckers your teeth.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14505src" href="#xd32e14505">297</a>
</p>
<p class="line">If you splash with your tail it shall break in two,
</p>
<p class="line">If you strike downwards with your snout it shall break in two,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">If you crunch with your teeth they shall all be broken.
</p>
<p class="line">Lo, Si Jambu Rakai, I bind (this fowl) with the sevenfold binding,
</p>
<p class="line">And enwrap it with the sevenfold wrapping
</p>
<p class="line">Which you shall never loosen or undo.
</p>
<p class="line">Turn it over in your mouth before you swallow it.
</p>
<p class="line">O, Si Jambu Rakai, accept this present from Her Highness Princess Rundok, from Java:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14522src" href="#xd32e14522">298</a>
</p>
<p class="line">If you refuse to accept it,
</p>
<p class="line">Within two days or three
</p>
<p class="line">You shall be … choked to death with blood,
</p>
<p class="line">Choked to death by Her Highness Princess Rundok, from Java.
</p>
<p class="line">But if you accept it,
</p>
<p class="line">A reach up-stream or a reach down-stream, there do you await me;
</p>
<p class="line">It is not my Word, it is King Solomon’s Word;
</p>
<p class="line">If you are carried down-stream see that you incline up-stream,
</p>
<p class="line">If you are carried up-stream see that you incline down-stream,
</p>
<p class="line">By virtue of the Saying of King Solomon, ‘There is no god but God,’ ” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then take a canoe paddle (to symbolise the crocodile’s tail) and some strong thread,
fasten one end of the thread to the front of the floating platform, and the other
end to the bow of your boat, back water till it grows taut, and strike the surface
of the water thrice with the aforesaid “mock” crocodile’s tail. If the first time
you strike it the sound is clearest (<i lang="ms">tĕrek bunyi</i>) it is an omen that the crocodile will swallow the bait the first day; if the second
time, it will be the second day when he does so; if the third time, it will be the
third day. But every time you strike the water you must say to yourself, “From Fatimah
was your origin” (<i lang="ms">Mani Fatimah asal’kau jadi</i>), in order to make the crocodile bold. After striking the water you may go home and
rest; but you must get up again in any case at about two in the afternoon (<i lang="ms">dlohor</i>), and whatever happens you must remember <span class="pageNum" id="pb300">[<a href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>never to pass underneath a low overhanging bough (because such a bough would resemble
the bent rod of the floating platform), and <i>never</i> (for the time being) to eat your curry without starting by swallowing three lumps
of rice successively. If you do this it will help the bait to slide more easily down
the crocodile’s throat, and in the same way you must <i>never</i>, until the brute is safely landed, take any bones out of the meat in your curry—if
you do, the wooden cross-piece is sure to get loose and work out of the fowl—so it
is just as well to get somebody to take the bones out of your meat before you begin,
otherwise you may at any moment be compelled to choose between swallowing a bone and
losing all your labour.
</p>
<p>I will pass on to the final capture. The crocodile has taken the bait, we will say,
and with the last of the ebb, not unfrequently in a perilously rickety boat, you go
out to look for the tell-tale end of the line that floats up among the forked roots
of the mangrove trees. First you must go to the place where you left the floating
platform; take hold of the pole to which it is moored and press it downwards into
the river-bottom, saying (to the hooked crocodile) as you do so:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Do not run away,
</p>
<p class="line">Our agreement was a cape (further) up-stream,
</p>
<p class="line">A cape (further) down-stream.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14560src" href="#xd32e14560">299</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">(Here hold your breath and press upon the pole.) Then wait for the tide to turn, search
for the end of the line (which, being of rattan, is sure to float) <span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>up and down the river banks, and when you find it take hold of the end and give it
three tugs, repeating as you do so this “crippling charm”:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“I know the origin from which you sprang,
</p>
<p class="line">From Fatimah did you take your origin.
</p>
<p class="line">Your bones (she made from) sugar-cane knots,
</p>
<p class="line">Your head from the cabbage of a cocoa-nut palm,
</p>
<p class="line">The skin of your breast from the leaf-case of a palm,
</p>
<p class="line">Your blood from saffron,
</p>
<p class="line">Your eyes from the star of the east,
</p>
<p class="line">Your teeth from the pointed suckers of the <i lang="ms">bĕrĕmbang</i> tree,
</p>
<p class="line">Your tail from the sprouting of a thatch-palm.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">As you utter the last words give the end of the line three twists (<i lang="ms">pioh</i>) and then clench the teeth upon it (<i lang="ms">katup di gigi</i>) thrice, holding your breath as you do so; then jerk it (<i lang="ms">rentak</i>) thrice and haul upon it (<i lang="ms">runtun</i>); if you feel much resistance slack it off again and repeat the ceremony, using the
“crippling charm” as before, “until you break all the bones in his body.” Besides
this, in order to drive the “mischief” out of the crocodile, you may say:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Pardon, King of the Sea, God of Currents,
</p>
<p class="line">I wish to drive the ‘mischief’ out of this crocodile.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14604src" href="#xd32e14604">300</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">And strike the water and middle of the line with the end of the line itself.
</p>
<p>Now you haul on the line, and the crocodile comes up to the top with a rush, and the
fun begins. As he comes up to the surface you ask him, “Was it you who caught <i>So-and-so</i>?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14616src" href="#xd32e14616">301</a> And if he wishes to reply in the affirmative he will bellow loudly. When he does
so, say, “Wind yourself up” (“<i lang="ms">lilit</i>”), and he will wind the line round his muzzle. And when you want <span class="pageNum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>to kill him, chop across the root of his tail with a cutlass; this will kill him at
once.
</p>
<p>I may add that it is not generally wise to keep a captured crocodile alive overnight,
as he happens to be one of the <i>clientèle</i> of a certain powerful <i lang="ms">hantu</i> (spirit) named <i lang="ms">Langsuir</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14635src" href="#xd32e14635">302</a> who comes to the assistance of his follower at night and endows him with supernatural
strength, thus enabling him, if he is not very sufficiently tied up, to get loose,
which might be awkward. You should also never bring one into the house, on account
of an understanding, prejudicial to yourself, which exists between him and the common
house-lizard (<i lang="ms">chichak</i>).
</p>
<p>Of the folklore which is concerned with other classes of “reptilia” that which deals
with Snakes is the most important.
</p>
<p>“The gall-bladder of the python, <i lang="ms">uler sawah</i>, is in great request among native practitioners. This serpent is supposed to have
two of these organs, one of which is called <i lang="ms">lampedu idup</i>, or the live gall-bladder. It is believed that if a python is killed and this organ
is cut out and kept, it will develop into a serpent of just twice the size of that
from which it was taken. The natives positively assert that the python attains a length
of sixty to seventy feet, and that it has been known to have killed and eaten a rhinoceros.
</p>
<p>“One of the pit vipers is exceedingly sluggish in its movements, and will remain in
the same place for days together. One individual that was watched, lay coiled up on
the branch of a tree for five days, and probably would have remained much longer,
but at the end of that time it was caught and preserved. <span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>The Malays call it <i lang="ms"><span class="corr" id="xd32e14658" title="Source: uler">ular</span> kapak daun</i>, and they say that it is fed three times a day by birds, who bring it insects to
eat. One man went so far as to say that he had actually once seen some birds engaged
in feeding one of these beautiful bright-green snakes.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14662src" href="#xd32e14662">303</a>
</p>
<p>In Selangor, as in Perak, the “live gall-bladder” of the python will (it is believed),
if kept in a jar, develop into a serpent; when dried it is in great request as a remedy
for small-pox. The story that Mr. Wray tells of the pit viper (<i lang="ms">ular kapak daun</i>) is in Selangor told of a snake called <i lang="ms">chintamani</i>. Selangor Malays say that it was once upon a time a Raja of the country, and that
the birds which bring it food were then its subjects. A Malay told me that he once
saw this operation, and that the birds fed it with insects. It is reputed to be a
perfectly harmless snake, and it is considered extremely lucky to keep one of the
species in one’s house, or even to see it. It is described as of a bright and glittering
blue<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14675src" href="#xd32e14675">304</a> colour (<i lang="ms">biru bĕrkilat-kilat</i>), and is frequently referred to in charms, especially those connected with the Rice-soul
ceremony, and is sometimes said to spring from the egg of the <i lang="ms">chandrawasih</i> or bird of paradise.
</p>
<p>The cobra (<i lang="ms">ular tĕdong</i>) is said to have a bright stone (<i lang="ms">kĕmala</i> or <i lang="ms">gĕmala</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14699src" href="#xd32e14699">305</a> in its head, the radiance of which causes its head to be visible on the darkest night.
A “snake bezoar” (<i lang="ms">guliga ular</i>) is also said <span class="pageNum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>to be occasionally found in the back of a snake’s head (?), whilst the snake-stone
(<i lang="ms">batu ular</i>) is carried in its mouth.
</p>
<p>This <i lang="ms">batu ular</i> is a prize for the possession of which snakes are not unfrequently believed to fight,
and appears to correspond to the pearl for which in Chinese legendary lore the dragons
of that country were believed to engage in mortal combat. A Malay remarked to me that
it was always worth while if one came upon two snakes thus engaged to kill them both,
as one of them was sure to possess this much-coveted stone, which is said to confer
an almost certain victory upon its possessor.
</p>
<p>Another species of “snake-stone,” which is said to be manufactured by <i>Pawangs</i> from gold, silver, amalgam (of silver and gold), tin, iron, and quicksilver, is called
<i lang="ms">Buntat Raksa</i>, and is said to be invaluable in case of snake-bite. It is believed that this stone
will adhere to the wound, and will not fall off until it has sucked out all the poison.
One of these stones, which was sold to me in Selangor for a dollar, was about an inch
long and oval in shape; it was evidently made of some mixture of metals, and was perforated
so as to enable it to be carried on a string.
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">ular gantang</i> is said to be a snake, though from the description given it would seem more likely
to be some species of slow-worm or blind-worm. It is only a “few inches” long, and
is “black,” and there is said to be little if any difference between its head and
its tail. It is considered to be extremely lucky, and when a Malay meets it, he spreads
out his head-cloth or turban on the ground, and allows it to enter, when he carries
it home and keeps it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb305">[<a href="#pb305">305</a>]</span></p>
<p>To dream of being bitten by a snake is thought to portend success in a love affair.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14731src" href="#xd32e14731">306</a>
</p>
<p>“A horned toad, known as <i lang="ms">katak bertandok</i>, but not the common one of that name (<i lang="la">Megalophrys nasuta</i>, Gunther), has a very bad reputation with the Malays. It is said to live in the jungle
on the hills, and wherever it takes up its abode all the trees and plants around wither
and die. So poisonous is it, that it is dangerous even to approach it, and to touch
or be bitten by it is certain death.
</p>
<p>“The bite of the common toad (<i lang="la">Bufo melanostictus</i>, Cantor) is also said to prove fatal. That toads have no teeth is an anatomical detail
that does not seem to be thought worthy of being taken into account.
</p>
<p>“The supposed venomous properties of this useful and harmless tribe have a world-wide
range. In Shakespeare many allusions to it are made; one of them, which mentions the
habit of hibernation possessed by those species which inhabit the colder parts of
the earth, says—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">‘In the poison’d entrails throw,
</p>
<p class="line">Toad, that under coldest stone
</p>
<p class="line">Days and nights hast thirty-one,
</p>
<p class="line">Swelter’d venom sleeping got,
</p>
<p class="line">Boil thou first i’ the charmed pot.’</p>
</div>
<p class="first">“In another, reference is made to the toad-stone, which seems to be represented in
Malayan tradition by the pearl carried in the bodies of the hamadryad, the cobra,
and the bungarus, the three most deadly snakes of the Peninsula:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">‘Sweet are the uses of adversity,
</p>
<p class="line">Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
</p>
<p class="line">Wears yet a precious jewel in its head.’</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb306">[<a href="#pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p class="first">“There is some foundation of fact for the popular belief, as toads <span class="corr" id="xd32e14765" title="Source: secret">secrete</span> an acrid fluid from the skin, which appears to defend them from the attacks of carnivorous
animals.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14768src" href="#xd32e14768">307</a>
</p>
<p>It may not be out of place to give here a Malay tradition about a species of snail:—
</p>
<p>“A strange superstition is attached to a small snail which frequents the neighbourhood
of the limestone hills in Perak. It belongs to the <i lang="la">Cyclophoridæ</i>, and is probably an <i lang="la">Alycæus</i>. Among the grass in the shadow of a grazing animal these creatures are to be discovered,
and if one of them is crushed it will be found to be full of blood, which has been
drawn in a mysterious way from the veins of the animal through its shadow. Where these
noxious snails abound, the cattle become emaciated and sometimes even die from the
constant loss of blood. In the folklore of other countries many parallels to this
occur, but they differ in either the birds, bats, or vampires, who are supposed to
prey on the life-blood of their fellows, going direct to the animals to suck the blood,
instead of doing so through the medium of their shadows.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14781src" href="#xd32e14781">308</a>

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">4.</span> FISHING CEREMONIES</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fish are in many cases credited by the Malay peasant with the same portentous ancestry
as that which he attributes to some of the larger animals and birds.
</p>
<p>“Many Malays refuse to eat the fresh-water fish called <i lang="ms">ikan belidah</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14796src" href="#xd32e14796">309</a> on the plea that it was originally <span class="pageNum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>a cat. They declare that it squalls like a cat when harpooned, and that its bones
are white and fine like a cat’s hairs. Similarly the <i lang="ms">ikan tumuli</i> is believed to be a human being who has been drowned in the river, and the <i lang="ms">ikan kalul</i> to be a monkey transformed. Some specially favoured observers have seen monkeys half
through the process of metamorphosis—half-monkey and half-fish.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14833src" href="#xd32e14833">310</a>
</p>
<p>Similarly, the Dugong (Malay <i lang="ms">duyong</i>) is asserted <span class="pageNum" id="pb308">[<a href="#pb308">308</a>]</span>by some Malays to have sprung from the remains of <i>a pig, which Muhammad himself dined off before he pronounced pork to be the accursed
thing</i>. Being cast by the Prophet into the sea, it revived and took the shape of the dugong,
in which shape it is still to be found off the coast of Lukut and Port Dickson, where
it feeds upon sea-grass (<i lang="ms">rumput sĕtul</i>), in common with a species of small <i lang="ms">tripang</i> or <i lang="fr">bêche-de-mer</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14859src" href="#xd32e14859">311</a>
</p>
<p>The origin of the Eel (<i lang="ms">ikan b’lut</i>) is derived from a stem of the <i lang="ms">g’li-g’li</i> plant; the “white-fish” (<i lang="ms">ikan puteh</i>) from splinters, or rather shavings of wood (<i lang="ms">tatal kayu</i> or <i lang="ms">tarahan kayu</i>); the <i lang="ms">sĕnunggang</i> fish from the long-tailed monkey (<i lang="ms">k’ra</i>); the <i lang="ms">aruan</i> fish from a frog (<i lang="ms">katak</i>) or lizard (<i lang="ms">mĕngkarong</i>); the <i lang="ms">bujok</i> fish from charred fire-logs (<i lang="ms">puntong api</i>); the <i lang="ms">telan</i> fish from the creeping roots of the yam (<i lang="ms">sulur k’ladi</i>); and so on. There is even the leaf of a certain tree which is sometimes said to
turn into a fish (the <i lang="ms">ikan bĕlidah</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14924src" href="#xd32e14924">312</a> while the following story is held to account for the origin of the Porpoise:—
</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a fishing-wizard (Pawang Pukat) who had encountered nothing
but misfortune from first to last, and who at length determined to put forth all his
skill in magic in one last desperate effort to repay the burden of debt which threatened
to crush him. One day, therefore, having tried his luck for the last time, and still
caught nothing, he requested his comrades to collect an immense quantity of mangrove
leaves in their boat. Having carried these leaves out to the fishing-ground, he scattered
<span class="pageNum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>them on the surface of the water, together with a few handfuls of parched and saffron-stained
rice, repeating a series of most powerful spells as he did so. The next time they
fished, the leaves had turned into fish of all shapes and sizes, and an immense haul
of fish was the result. The wizard then gave directions for the payment in full of
all his debts and the division of the balance among his children, and then without
further warning plunged into the sea only to reappear as a porpoise.
</p>
<p>“A species of fish-like tadpole,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14936src" href="#xd32e14936">313</a> found at certain seasons of the year in the streams and pools, is supposed to divide
when it reaches maturity, the front portion forming a frog and the after-part or tail
becoming the fish known as <i lang="ms">ikan kli</i>, one of the cat-fishes or <i lang="la">Siluridæ</i>. In consequence of this strange idea many Malays will not eat the fish, deeming it
but little better than the animal from which it is supposed to have been cast.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">ikan kli</i> is armed with two sharp barbed spines attached to the fore-part of the pectoral fins,
and can and does inflict very nasty wounds with them, when incautiously handled. The
spines are reputed to be poisonous, but it is believed that if the brain of the offending
fish is applied to the wound, it will act as a complete antidote to the poisonous
principle, and the wound will heal without trouble. The English cure for hydrophobia—that
is, ‘the hair of the dog that bit you’—will occur to all as a modification of the
same idea.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14959src" href="#xd32e14959">314</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fish called <i lang="ms">sĕluang</i> is used for purposes of magic. It is supposed that any one who pokes out its eyes
with a special needle (which must be one out of a score—the packets being made up
in scores—and must possess a torn eye) will be able to inflict blindness, by sympathy,
upon any person against whom he has a grudge.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14969src" href="#xd32e14969">315</a>
</p>
<p>The fish called <i lang="ms">kĕdĕra</i> is supposed to change into a sea-bird.
</p>
<p>I will now proceed to describe the ceremony which is supposed to secure an abundant
catch of fish in the stakes.
</p>
<p>In January 1897 I witnessed the ceremony of sacrificing at the fishing-stakes (<i lang="ms">mĕnyemah b’lat</i>) which took place at the hamlet of Ayer Hitam (lit. “Blackwater”), in the coast district
of Kuala Langat (Selangor). The chief performer of the rites was an old Malay named
Bilal Umat, who had owned one of the fishing-stakes in the neighbourhood for many
years past, and had annually officiated at the ceremony which I was about to witness.
I and my small party arrived in the course of the morning, and were received by Bilal
Umat, who conducted us to the long, low palm-thatch building (<i lang="ms">bangsal kelong</i>), just above high-water mark, in which he and his men resided during the fishing-season.
Here we found that a feast was in course of preparation, but what most attracted my
attention was the sight of three large sacrificial basket-work trays,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14991src" href="#xd32e14991">316</a> each about 2½ feet square, and with high fringed sides which were suspended in a
row from the roof of the verandah, on the seaward side of the building. <span class="pageNum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>These trays were empty, but had been lined with banana leaves to prepare them for
the reception of the offerings, which latter were displayed upon a raised platform
standing just in front of them.
</p>
<div class="figure fig1width" id="fig1"><img src="images/fig01.png" alt="Fig. 1.—Ceremony of sacrificing at the fishing-stakes." width="503" height="373"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>—Ceremony of sacrificing at the fishing-stakes.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Shortly after our arrival the loading of the trays commenced. First Bilal Umat took
a large bowl of parched rice, and poured it into the trays, until the bottom of each
tray was filled with a layer of parched rice about an inch in depth.
</p>
<p>Next he took a bowl of saffron-stained rice, and deposited about five portions of
it in the centre and four corners of each tray; then he made a similar distribution
of small portions of washed rice, of sweet potatoes (<i lang="ms">k’ledek</i>), of yams (<i lang="ms">k’ladi</i>), of tapioca (<i lang="ms">ubi kayu</i>), of bananas (<i lang="ms">pisang</i>), and betel-leaf (<i lang="ms">sirih</i>)—there being two sets, one cooked and one uncooked, of each of these portions, except
the last. Finally, he <span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>added one cigarette to each portion, the cigarette being intended for the spirits
to smoke after their meal!
</p>
<p>A fine black goat, “without blemish and without spot,” had been killed by Bilal Umat
early that morning, and he now deposited its head in the middle of the central tray,
two of the feet in the middle of the right-hand tray, and the other two feet in the
middle of that on the left. To each of these three central portions were now added
small portions of the animal’s viscera (liver, spleen, lights, tripe, heart, etc.),
and then the small diamond-shaped (<i lang="ms">kĕtupat</i>) and cylindrical (<i lang="ms">lĕpat</i>) rice-bags<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15036src" href="#xd32e15036">317</a> were suspended in the usual manner. A wax taper was added to each portion of each
tray, and the loading of the trays declared complete.
</p>
<p>Everything being now ready, Bilal Umat carried a smoking censer thrice round the row
of trays (walking always towards the left), and then lighting the five wax tapers
of the left-hand tray, directed two of his men to take down this tray and sling it
on a pole between them. This they did, and we set off in procession along the sandy
foreshore at the back of the building until we came to a halt at a spot about fifty
yards off, where Bilal Umat suspended the tray from the branch of a mangrove-tree
about five feet from the ground. This done, he faced round towards the land, and breaking
off a branch of the tree, gave utterance to three stentorian cooees, which he afterwards
informed me were intended to notify the Land Spirits (<i lang="ms">Orang darat</i>, lit. “Land Folk”) of the fact that offerings were awaiting their acceptance. Returning
to the house, he manufactured one of the leaf-brushes<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15048src" href="#xd32e15048">318</a> which the Malays always used <span class="pageNum" id="pb313">[<a href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>for the “Neutralising Rice-paste” (<i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>) rite, and we then started in a couple of boats for the fishing-stakes, taking with
us the two remaining trays.
</p>
<p>Of these two trays, one was suspended by Bilal Umat from a high wooden tripod which
had been erected for the purpose, the site selected being the centre of a shoal about
half-way between the fishing-stakes and the house. The third tray, which contained
the head of the goat (<i lang="ms">kapala kambing dĕngan buah-nya</i>), was then taken on to the fishing-stakes, Bilal Umat disposing of a large quantity
of miscellaneous offerings which he had brought with him in a basket by strewing them
upon the surface of the sea as we went along.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15109src" href="#xd32e15109">319</a>
</p>
<p>On reaching the stakes, the Pawang (Bilal Umat) <span class="pageNum" id="pb314">[<a href="#pb314">314</a>]</span>suspended the tray from a projecting pole at the seaward end of the fishing-stakes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15293src" href="#xd32e15293">320</a> and then seating himself upon one of the timbers almost directly underneath it, scattered
handfuls of saffron-stained rice, “washed” rice, and native cigarettes upon the water,
just outside the two seaward posts at the end of the stakes, and emptied out the remainder
of the parched rice upon the water just inside the “head” of the stakes. Then he recited
a charm, stirred the bowl of neutralising rice-paste (<i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>) with the brush of leaves, and taking the latter out of the bowl, sprinkled, or rather
daubed it first upon the two “tide-braces” of the stakes (first upon the left “tide-brace,”
and then upon the right), then upon the heads of the two upright posts next to the
tide-braces, and then delegated the brush to two assistants. One of these sprinkled
the heads of all the (remaining) upright posts in the seaward compartment of the stakes,
while the other boarded the big boat belonging to the stakes, and sprinkled the boat
and all its gear from stem to stern (commencing on the left side of the bows, and
working right down to the stern, and then recommencing on the right and working down
to the stern again). Finally, the same assistant returning to the stakes, washed the
rice-bowl in the sea just beneath the place where Bilal Umat was sitting, and fastened
up the leaf-brush to the left-hand head-post (<i lang="ms">kayu puchi kiri</i>) at the seaward end of the stakes. To the above account I may add that a number of
taboos are still pretty rigorously enforced by the fishing-wizards (Pawang B’lat)
upon the coast of Selangor. I was never allowed to take either an umbrella or boots
into the fishing-stakes <span class="pageNum" id="pb315">[<a href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>when I visited them—the spirits having, I was told, the strongest possible objection
to the use of either.
</p>
<p>Other “perpetual taboos” (<i lang="ms">pantang salama-lama-nya</i>) are to bathe without wearing a bathing-cloth (<i lang="ms">mandi tĕlanjang</i>), to throw the wet bathing-cloth over the shoulder when returning to the house, and
to rub one foot against the other (<i lang="ms">gosok satu kaki dĕngan lain</i>). <i>Sarongs</i>, umbrellas, and shoes must never on any pretence be worn. I may add that the first
pole planted is called <i lang="ms">Turus Tuah</i> (<i lang="ms">tua?</i>), and if the response of the spirits to the invocation be favourable, it is believed
that it will enter the ground readily, as if pulled from below. The only seven-days’
taboo which I have heard mentioned (though, no doubt, there are many others) is the
scrupulous observance of chastity.
</p>
<p>A boat which possesses a knot in the centre of its keel, or to which the smell of
fish long adheres (<i lang="ms">p’rahu pĕranyir</i>, or <i lang="ms">pĕrhanyir</i>), is supposed to bring good luck to the fishermen.
</p>
<p>There is also a regular “taboo language” used by the fishermen, of which the following
are examples:—
</p>
<ul>
<li>“Fish = <i lang="ms">daun kayu</i> (tree-leaves) or <i lang="ms">sampah laut</i> (jetsam).</li>
<li>Snake = <i lang="ms">akar hidup</i> (living creeper).</li>
<li>Crocodile = <i lang="ms">batang kayu</i> (tree-log).</li>
<li>Seaward compartment of the stakes (<i lang="ms">bunohan</i>) = <i lang="ms">kurong</i>.”</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>At the close of the ceremony Bilal Umat repeated to me one of the <i lang="ms">kelong</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15366src" href="#xd32e15366">321</a> invocations which he had just been making use of, and which ran as follows:—

<p class="first">“Procuring fire by friction is an accomplishment as common to the Malay as to the
North American Indian. The process is, however, slightly different. While the latter
resorts to circular friction, the Malay cuts a notch on the converse surface of a
bamboo, <i>across</i> which he rapidly rubs another piece cut to a sharp edge. A fine powder is rubbed
away and this ignites. Bamboo is also used as a flint with tinder. The all-pervading
match, however, is alone used in all districts under foreign influence.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15483src" href="#xd32e15483">324</a>
</p>
<p>The foregoing description requires to be supplemented, for the method of procuring
fire by circular friction is hardly (if at all) less common among the Malays than
the method of cross friction. The former process takes the form of the well-known
“fire-drill,” both the block and the upright stick being generally made of <i lang="ms">mahang</i> wood. The upright stick is frequently worked by a species of “bow,” such as that
used by carpenters, and is kept from jumping out of the socket in which it revolves
<span class="pageNum" id="pb318">[<a href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>by means of a cocoa-nut shell, which is pressed down from above. When cross friction
is used, a long narrow slit is usually cut, following the grain, in the convex surface
of the piece of bamboo, the dust which is rubbed away falling through it and gradually
forming a little pile which presently ignites. It is hardly necessary to cut a notch
for the cross-piece, as a groove is very quickly worn when the friction is started.
A species of fire-syringe has also, I believe, been collected by Mr. L. Wray in Perak.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In procuring fire by circular or cross friction the performer will often say, by way
of a charm—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“The Mouse-deer asks for Fire<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15506src" href="#xd32e15506">325</a>
</p>
<p class="line">To singe his mother-in-law’s feathers.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The “mouse-deer’s mother-in-law” is the name of a small bird, which is said to have
very gay plumage of five colours and to resemble the green pigeon (<i lang="ms">punei</i>) in shape, and the explanation of this charm is said to be that in the days of King
Solomon, when both the mouse-deer and his mother-in-law wore their human forms, the
Mouse-deer was greatly annoyed by the conduct of his mother-in-law, who kept dancing
in front of him as he went. A quarrel ensued,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15520src" href="#xd32e15520">326</a> as the result of which they were both transformed into the shapes which they now
respectively bear; but the mother-in-law has not yet abandoned her exasperating tactics,
and may still often be seen <span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>tantalising the Mouse-deer by hopping in front of it as it goes along.
</p>
<p>There are still some traces of the influence of animistic ideas in that part of Malay
folklore which is concerned with fire. If an inflammable object, such as wood, falls
by accident into the fire, a stick must be used in extracting it, and the stick left,
as a substitute, in its place.
</p>
<p>The hearth-fire (<i lang="ms">api dapor</i>) must never be stepped over (<i lang="ms">di-langkah-nya</i>), nor must the rice-pot which stands upon it, as in the latter case the person who
does so will be “cursed by the Rice.”
</p>
<p>Both fire and smoke (fumigation) are a good deal used by the Malays for purposes of
ceremonial purification, but the details of such rites cannot be conveniently discussed
except in connection with the complete ceremonies of which they form a part; they
will accordingly be found under such headings as Birth, Adolescence, Marriage, Medicine,
and Funerals.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15539src" href="#xd32e15539">327</a>

<p class="footnote cont">“Like the night-jar at a deserted house.”

<p class="footnote cont">The <i lang="ms">tegok</i> or <i lang="ms">tetegok</i> is a bird common in the Malay Peninsula, whose habits are nocturnal and solitary.
It has a peculiar, liquid, monotonous call. The phrase is used to signify the solitude

</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Elsewhere (in notes afterwards published in the <i>Selangor Journal</i>) (vol. i. No. 23, p. 360) Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell says “The <i lang="ms">burong tetegok</i> is not a night bird, but flies by day. It can be distinguished by its short rapid
note, which resembles <i lang="ms">tegok-tegok-tegok-tegok</i>.” Apparently Sir W.&nbsp;E.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e6418src">16</a></span> As it appears that in Europe, at all events, the legend of the Wild Huntsman and his
dogs (or Gabriel’s Hounds, as they are often called) is explained by the cries of
wild geese flying overhead on dark nights, it seems most convenient to give the Malay legend in connection with the birds with which the Malays
associate him. The explanation to which I refer is to be found in Prof. Newton’s <i>Dictionary of Birds</i> (1893), <i>sub voce</i> “Gabble-ratchet.” I quote <i>in extenso</i>:—
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“In many parts of England, but especially in Yorkshire, the cries of some kind of
wild goose,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6431src" href="#xd32e6431">17</a> when flying by night, are heard with dismay by those who do not know the cause of
them, and are attributed to ‘Gabriel’s Hounds,’ an expression equivalent to ‘Gabble-ratchet,’
a term often used for them, as in this sense <i>gabble</i> is said to be a corruption of <i>Gabriel</i>, and that, according to some mediæval glossaries, is connected with <i lang="ms">gabbara</i> or <i lang="ms">gabares</i>, a word meaning a corpse (cp. Way, <i lang="la">Promptorium Parvulorum</i>, p. 320, <i>sub voce</i> ‘Lyche’); while <i>ratchet</i> is undoubtedly the same as the Anglo-Saxon <i>ræce</i> and Middle English <i>racche</i> or <i>rache</i>, a dog that hunts by scent and gives tongue. Hence the expression would originally
mean ‘corpse-hounds,’ and possibly has to do with legends such as that of the Wild
Huntsman.… The sounds are at times very marvellous, not to say impressive, when heard,
as they almost invariably are, on a pitch-dark night, and it has more than once happened
within the writer’s knowledge that a flock of geese, giving utterance to them, has
continued for some hours to circle over a town or village in such a way as to attract
the attention of the most unobservant of its inhabitants, and inspire with terror
those among them who are prone to superstition. (Cp. Atkinson, <i>Notes and Queries</i>, ser. 4, vii. pp. 439, 440, and <i>Cleveland Glossary</i>, p. 203<span class="corr" id="xd32e6468" title="Not in source">)</span>; Herrtage, <i lang="la">Catholicon Anglicum</i>, p. 147; Robinson, <i>Glossary Whitby</i>, (Engl.

the Selangor coast, where three subordinate officers of the Government (foremen of
works) had died successively, at comparatively short intervals. The last of these
men, I was informed by the local Malays, received a kick from the Spectre Huntsman
(<i lang="ms">di-sepak uleh Hantu Pĕmburu</i>) as he was going down the hill to the village in the morning. He took no notice of
the occurrence and proceeded down the river in a boat. Three hours later he vomited
mangrove leaves(!) and was brought back dead! Cp. <i>N. and Q.</i>, No. 2, sec. 32 (issued with <i>J.R.A.S.</i>, <i>S.B.</i>, No. 15).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e6798src" title="Return to note 27 in text.">↑</a></p>

the number of scales on its feet, for counting which certain verbal categories (like
our own “tinker, tailor, soldier” formula) are used. Forty-four is the luckiest number
of scales for one of these birds to possess. An example is: “<i lang="ms">Manuk</i> (3), <i lang="ms">Manumah</i> (5), <i lang="ms">Sangkesa</i> (6), <i lang="ms">Desa</i> (1), <i lang="ms">Dewa</i> (4), <i lang="ms">Raja</i> (2),” which has to be repeated as the scales are counted (beginning with the lowest
scale). The numbers after the words indicate the order of the luck which the birds
are supposed to bring; a ground-dove of the first order bringing luck worth a ship’s

There can, however, be little doubt that the original victim of this sacrifice was
a human victim (generally perhaps a slave), for whom the buffalo was substituted (the
goat, fowl, and egg representing further successive stages in the depreciation of
the rite). Malays on the Selangor coast more than once told me they had heard that
the Government was in the habit of burying a human head under the foundations of any
unusually large structure (<i>e.g.</i> a bridge), and two cases where a local scare resulted from the prevalence of this

<p class="footnote cont">“They (the Sumatran Malays) seem to think, indeed, that tigers in general are actuated
with the spirits of departed men, and no consideration will prevail on a countryman
to catch or to wound one, but in self-defence, or immediately after the act of destroying
a friend or relation. They speak of them with a degree of awe, and hesitate to call
them by their common name (<i lang="ms">rimau</i> or <i lang="ms">machang</i>), terming them respectfully <i lang="ms">satwa</i> (the wild animals), or even <i lang="ms">nenek</i> (ancestors), as really believing them such, or by way of soothing or coaxing them,
as our ignorant country folk call the fairies ‘the good people.’ ” [<i lang="ms">Dato’ hutan</i>, “elder of the jungle,” is the common title of the tiger in Selangor. Various nicknames,
however, are given, e.g. <i lang="ms">Si Pudong</i>, “he of the hairy face” (Cliff., <i>In Court and Kampong</i>, p. 201), <i lang="ms">’Pah Randau</i>, “father shaggy-face,” etc.] “When an European procures traps to be set … the inhabitants
of the neighbourhood have been known to go at night to the place and practise some
forms in order to persuade the animal, when caught, or when he shall perceive the
bait, that it was not laid by them or with their consent. <i>They talk of a place in the country where the tigers have a court, and maintain a
regular form of government, in towns, the houses of which are thatched with women’s
hair.</i>”—Marsden, <i>l.c.</i> (The italics are mine.) It is curious that the Fairy Princess’ hall on Gunong Ledang
is similarly described in the <i lang="ms">Sĕjarah Malayu</i> (<i>Malay Annals</i>, p. 279) as being of bone and thatched with hair.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e8215src" title="Return to note 80 in text.">↑</a></p>

shrank into a corner of the trap. A single inch of this wood is thought an adequate

a gorse stick (which I had bought some years before in Ireland) was taken to be a

</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“The <i lang="ms">sialang</i> (that is, a tree on which bees have made nests) is generally considered to belong
to him who finds it, provided it stands in a part of the forest belonging to his tribe.
Should the tree stand in a part of the jungle apportioned to another tribe, the finder
is permitted to take for once all the wax there is on the tree, and ever afterwards,
during his lifetime, all the wax of one branch of the tree. After his death the tree
becomes the property of the tribe to whom that part of the jungle belongs.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“When wax is collected from a tree there are generally three persons to share in it,
and the proceeds are divided as follows: viz., one-third to the proprietor of the
tree, one-third to the man who climbs the tree, and one-third to the man who keeps
watch below. These two latter offices are considered rather dangerous, the first because
he has to climb the towering <i lang="ms">sialang</i> trees, branchless to a considerable height, by means of bamboo pegs driven into the
trunk; and the watch-keeper underneath, because he has to face the bears and tigers

which, falling into the pith-chamber of the wood, is extracted thence or exudes from
the cracks. This I saw in a table of camphor wood at a certain apothecary’s, and in
a piece of wood as thick as the thigh, presented to me by Governor John Crasto, and
again in a tablet a span broad at a merchant’s. I would not, however, deny that it
may sometimes be deposited in the hollow of a tree. It is told me as a fact, that
it is the custom that when any one who goes out to collect it has filled his gourd,
if any other stronger person sees him with the gourd, he can kill him with impunity
and take away the gourd, fortune assisting him in this. That which is brought from
Borneo is usually mixed with small bits of stone, or some kind of gum called Chamderros,
much like raw sugar or sawdust. But this defect is easily detected; I know no other
method of adulteration. For if sometimes it is seen to be spotted with red or blackish
dots, that is due to treatment with dirty or impure hands, or they may be caused by
moisture. But this defect is easily remedied by the Indians. If it is tied up in a
cloth and dipped in warm water to which soap and lime-juice has been added, and then
carefully dried in the shade, it becomes very white, the weight not being altered.
I saw this done by a Hindu friend who entrusted me with the secret.… What they say
as to all kinds of animals flying together to its shade to escape the fiercer beasts
is fabulous. Nor is it what some, following Serapion, write less so, namely, that
it is an omen of larger yields when the sky glitters with frequent lightning, or echoes with constant thunder. For as
the island of Sumatra, which some think to be Taprobane, and the adjacent regions
are near the equinoctial line, it follows that they are subject to constant thunderstorms,
and for the same cause have storms or slight showers every day; so camphor ought to
be abundant every year. From which it is clear that the thunder is neither the cause
nor indication of a larger supply of camphor.”—Garcia in the <i lang="la">Historia Aromatum</i> (1593), quoted in <i>J.R.A.S.</i>, <i>S.B.</i>, No. 26, p. 37.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“The camphor is so far considered as a <i lang="ms">barang larangan</i> that nobody is allowed to go and collect it without having a special permit from
the Sultan. This permit is only given after the Sultan has made sure that a good <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> accompanies the party, a man who is able to know from the outside of a tree whether
it contains camphor or not.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“The gratuity to be given to the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> is not fixed by law, but is settled beforehand on every expedition; also the share
of the Sultan.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“The regulations which have to be observed when collecting camphor are most strange;
for instance, those who go on the expedition are not permitted during the whole time
of its duration to wash or bathe; they have to use a peculiar language, which differs
from ordinary Malay. Compare what is known on this point of similar usages amongst
the Battaks.

(in which the names appear as Ampu and Malin). “The name of its (the country of Palembang’s)
river was Muartatang (Muartenang ?) into which falls another river named Sungey Malayu
(Malay River), near the source of which is a mountain named the mountain Sagantang
Maha Miru (<i>v.</i> p. 2, <i>supra</i>). There were two young women of Belidung, the one named Wan-Ampu, and the other Wan-Malin,
employed in cultivating rice on this mountain, where they had large and productive
rice-grounds. One night they beheld their rice-fields gleaming and glittering like
fire. Then said Ampu to Malin, ‘What is that light which is so brilliant? I am frightened
to look at it.’ ‘Make no noise,’ said Malin, ‘it is some great snake or <i>naga</i>.’ Then they both lay quiet for fear. When it was daylight they arose and went to
see what it was shone so bright during the night. They both ascended the hill, and
found the grain of the rice converted into gold, the leaves into silver, and the stalks
into brass, and they were extremely surprised, and said, ‘This is what we observed
during the night.’ ” The account proceeds to show how the prodigy was due to a supernatural
visit from a descendant of Raja Secander Zulkarneini.—Leyden, <i>Mal. Ann.</i>, pp. 20, 21. The words in brackets are mine.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e11923src" title="Return to note 212 in text.">↑</a></p>

to the roof of your mouth, and contract the throat thrice, slowly swallowing as you
do so.” To the above she then added: “Besides this, you can make the whole field of
rice break into waves by standing up, clapping the hands, and then pushing each hand
right up the sleeve of the opposite arm (I am not quite sure if I rightly understood
this last, but am fairly certain that it is correct—my notes have only ‘run the hands

those from which tin-ore was being removed; if the daily output of tin suddenly decreased
on any mine it was his business at once to repeat certain invocations (<i lang="ms">puja</i>) to induce the tin-ore to remain (<i lang="ms">handak di-pulih balik sapaya jangan mengorang biji</i>). Once in every two or three years it was necessary to carry out an important ceremony
(<i lang="ms">puja besar</i>) which involved the slaying of three buffaloes and a great feast, the expense of
which had to be borne by the <i lang="ms">pawang</i>. On the day of the <i lang="ms">puja besar</i> strict abstinence from work is enjoined on every one in the district, no one might
break ground or even pull up weeds or cut wood in the whole province. Further, no
stranger whose home was three days’ journey away might enter one of the mines under
a penalty of twenty-five dollars.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The <i lang="ms">pawang</i> was entitled to exact from the owners of mines a customary payment of one slab of
tin (or $6.25 in cash) per annum for every sluice-box (<i lang="ms">palong</i>) in work during the year.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">In any mine from which the tin-ore had not yet been removed it was strictly forbidden
to wear shoes or to carry an umbrella; no Malay might wear a <i lang="ms">sarong</i>.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The Chinese miners, always superstitiously disposed, used (under Malay rule) to adhere

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e13842src">276</a></span> “The Guliga, more commonly known as Bezoar, forms a recognised article of export from
the Rejang and Bintulu rivers in the Sarawak territory. These concretions are chiefly
obtained from a red monkey (a species of <i lang="la">Semnopithecus</i>), which seems to be very abundant in the interior districts of Borneo. A more valuable
Guliga, called the ‘Guliga Landak,’ is obtained from the porcupine, but it is comparatively
rare. The Sepoys stationed at Sibu Fort in the Rejang formerly exported considerable
numbers of these calculi to Hindustan, where, in addition to their supposed efficacy
as an antidote for the poison of snakes and other venomous creatures, they appear
to be applied, either alone or in combination with other medicines, to the treatment
of fevers, asthmatic complaints, general debility, etc. A few years ago, however,
these men ceased to send any but the Guliga Landak, since their <i lang="ms">hakims</i> had informed them that the concretions obtained from the monkeys had come to be considered
of very doubtful, if any, value from a medicinal point of view. The usual test for
a good Guliga is to place a little <i lang="ms">chunam</i> on the hand and to rub the Guliga against it, when, if it be genuine, the lime becomes
tinged with yellow. Imitations are by no means rare, and on one occasion which came
to my own knowledge, some Bakatans succeeded in deceiving the Chinamen, who trade
in these articles, by carefully moulding some fine light clay into the form of a Bezoar,
and then rubbing it well all over with a genuine one. The extreme lightness of a real
Guliga and the lime test are, however, generally sufficient to expose a counterfeit
Bezoar. The Sepoys and Malays apply various imaginary tests. Thus they assert that
if a true Guliga be clasped in the closed fist the bitter taste of the concretion
will be plainly susceptible to the tongue when applied to the back of the hand, and
even above the elbow if the Guliga be a good ‘Landak’; and a Sepoy once assured me
that having accidentally broken one of the latter he immediately was sensible of a
bitter taste in the mouth.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“Accounts vary very much among the natives as to the exact position in which the Guligas
are found: some saying they may occur in any part of the body, others that they occur
only in the stomach and intestines, whilst I have heard others declare that they have
taken them from the head and even the hand! Bezoar stones are sold by weight, the
gold scale being used, and the value varies according to quality and to the scarcity
or abundance of the commodity at the time of sale. The ordinary prices paid at Rejang
a few years ago were from $1.50 to $2 per <i lang="ms">amas</i> for common stones and from $2.50 to $4 per <i lang="ms">amas</i> for Guliga Landak. I have seen one of the latter which was valued at $100. It was
about the size of an average Tangiers orange, and was perfectly spherical. The surface,
where not artificially abraded, was smooth, shining, bronze-brown, studded with numerous
irregularly-shaped fragments of dark rich brown standing out slightly above the general
mass of the calculus. These fragments, in size and appearance, bore a close resemblance
to the crystals in a coarse-grained porphyritic rock.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“The common monkey-bezoars vary much in colour and shape. I have seen them of the
size of large filberts, curiously convoluted and cordate in shape, with a smooth,
shining surface of a pale olive-green hue. Mr. A.&nbsp;R. Houghton once showed me one which
was an inch and a half long, and shaped like an Indian club. It was of a dirty greenish
colour, perfectly smooth and cylindrical, and it had become aggregated around a portion
of a sumpitan dart, which appears to have penetrated the animal’s stomach, and being
broken off short has subsequently served as the nucleus for the formation of a calculus.
The same gentleman had in his possession two Landak stones, one of which bore a close
resemblance to a block in shape, and was of a bright green colour, and the second
was of a rich chocolate brown, and could best be likened in form to a constable’s
staff. One porcupine stone which was opened was found to be a mere shell full of small brown shavings like shred tobacco.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“The part of the island which produces these stones in greatest abundance seems to
be, by a coincidence of native reports, the district about the upper waters of the
Baluñgar (Batang Kayan). The story is that the head-waters of this river are cut off
from its lower course by an extensive tract of hills beneath which the river disappears,
a report by no means unlikely if the country be, as is probable, limestone. The people
of the district have no communication with the lower course of the river, and are
thus without any supply of salt. In lieu of this necessity they make use of the waters
of certain springs, which must be saline mineral springs, and which the Kayans call
‘Suñgan.’ These springs are also frequented by troops of the red monkeys before mentioned,
and the Bezoars are most constantly found in the stomachs of these animals through
their drinking the saline water. The hunters lie in wait about such springs, and,
so runs the report, on the animals coming down to drink they are able to guess with
tolerable certainty from external signs which of the monkeys will afford the Guliga,
and they forthwith shoot such with their sumpitans. I have this account, curious in
more ways than one, from several quite independent sources. In concluding these brief
notes, I may remark that the wide-spread idea of the medicinal virtue of these concretions
would lead us to suppose that there is some foundation for their reputation.”—<i>J.R.A.S.</i>, <i>S.B.</i>, No. 4, pp. 56–58.

<p class="footnote cont">“The <i lang="ms">guliga</i> in Siak, which is considered to belong to the <i lang="ms">larangan raja</i> [royal property], is an intestinal stone found in a kind of porcupine living principally
in the upper reaches of the Mandau. The Sakeis living in this region are the only

<p class="footnote cont">Cp. the following note in Sale’s <i>Translation of the Korân</i>:—
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“This miracle is thus related by the commentators. Jesus having, at the request of
his followers, asked it of God, a red table immediately descended, in their sight,
between two clouds, and was set before them, whereupon he rose up, and having made
the ablution, prayed, and then took off the cloth which covered the table, saying,
<i>In the name of God, the best provider of food</i>. What the provisions were with which this table was furnished is a matter wherein
the expositors are not agreed. One will have them to be nine cakes of bread and nine
fishes; another, bread and flesh; another, all sorts of food, except flesh; another,
all sorts of food except bread and flesh; another, all except bread and fish; another,
one fish, which had the taste of all manner of food; and another, fruits of paradise,
but the most received tradition is that when the table was uncovered, there appeared
a fish ready dressed, without scales or prickly fins, dropping with fat, having salt
placed at its head and vinegar at its tail, and round it all sorts of herbs, except
leeks, and five loaves of bread, on one of which there were olives, on the second
honey, on the third butter, on the fourth, cheese, and on the fifth, dried flesh.
They add that Jesus, at the request of the apostles, showed them another miracle,
by restoring the fish to life, and causing its scales and fins to return to it, at
which the standers-by being affrighted, he caused it to become as before; that 1300
men and women, all afflicted with bodily infirmities or poverty, ate of these provisions
and were satisfied, the fish remaining whole as it was at first; that then the table
flew up to heaven in the sight of all; and every one who had partaken of this food
were delivered from their infirmities and misfortunes; and that it continued to descend
for forty days together at dinner-time, and stood on the ground till the sun declined,
and was then taken up into the clouds. Some of the Mohammedan writers are of opinion
that this table did not really descend, but that it was only a parable; but most think
the words of the Koran are plain to the contrary. A further tradition is, that several
men were changed into swine for disbelieving this miracle, and attributing it to magic
art; or, as others pretend, for stealing some of the victuals from off it. Several
other fabulous circumstances are also told which are scarce worth transcribing.”—Sale’s

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We now come to the spirits which are believed to attack both women and children at
childbirth.
</p>
<p>These are four in number: the Bajang, which generally takes the form of a pole-cat
(<i lang="ms">musang</i>) and disturbs the household by mewing like a great cat; the Langsuir, which takes
the form of an owl with long claws, which sits and hoots upon the roof-tree; the Pontianak
or Mati-anak, which, as will be seen presently, is also a night-owl, and is supposed
to be a child of the Langsuir, and the Pĕnanggalan, which is believed to resemble
a trunkless human head with the sac of the stomach attached to it, and which flies
about seeking for an opportunity of sucking the blood of infants.
</p>
<p>With the above are often associated the Polong, which is described as a diminutive
but malicious species of bottle-imp, and the Pĕlĕsit, which is the name given to a
kind of grasshopper (or cricket?), but these latter, though often associated with
the regular birth-spirits, partake also of the character of <span class="pageNum" id="pb321">[<a href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>familiar spirits<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15569src" href="#xd32e15569">1</a> or bottle-imps, and are usually private property.

<p><i>Page 321.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>I will now take these spirits in the above order. The Bajang, as I have said, is generally
described as taking the form of a pole-cat (<i lang="ms">musang</i>), but it appears to be occasionally confused with the Pĕlĕsit. Thus a Malay magician
once told me that the Bajang took the form of a house-cricket, and that when thus
embodied it may be kept by a man, as the Pĕlĕsit may be kept by a woman. This statement,
however, must not be accepted without due reserve, and it may be taken as a certainty
that the usual conception of the Bajang’s embodiment is a pole-cat.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15593src" href="#xd32e15593">2</a>
</p>
<p>I need hardly say that it is considered very dangerous to children, who are sometimes
provided with a sort of armlet of black silk threads, called a “bajang bracelet” (<i lang="ms">g’lang bajang</i>), which, it is supposed, will protect them against it. On the opposite page will
<span class="pageNum" id="pb322">[<a href="#pb322">322</a>]</span>be seen a remarkable drawing<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15606src" href="#xd32e15606">3</a> (of which a facsimile is here given), which appears to represent the outline of a
Bajang, “scripturally” modified to serve as a counter-charm against the Bajang itself.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15609src" href="#xd32e15609">4</a>
</p>
<p>The following account of the Bajang is by Sir Frank Swettenham:—
</p>
<p>“Some one in the village falls ill of a complaint the symptoms of which are unusual;
there may be convulsions, unconsciousness, or delirium, possibly for some days together
or with intervals between the attacks. The relatives will call in a native doctor,
and at her (she is usually an ancient female) suggestion, or without it, an impression
will arise that the patient is the victim of a <i lang="ms">bâjang</i>. Such an impression quickly develops into certainty, and any trifle will suggest
the owner of the evil spirit. One method of verifying this suspicion is to wait till
the patient is in a state of delirium, and then to question him or her as to who is
the author of the trouble. This should be done by some independent person of authority,
who is supposed to be able to ascertain the truth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>“A further and convincing proof is then to call in a ‘<i lang="ms">Pawang</i>’ skilled in dealing with wizards (in Malay countries they are usually men), and if
he knows his business his power is such that he will place the sorcerer in one room,
and, while he in another scrapes an iron vessel with a razor, the culprit’s hair will
fall off as though the razor had been applied to his head instead of to the vessel!
That is supposing he <i>is</i> the culprit; if not, of course he will pass through the ordeal without damage.
</p>
<p>“I have been assured that the shaving process is so efficacious that, as the vessel
represents the head of the person standing his trial, wherever it is scraped the wizard’s
hair will fall off in a corresponding spot. It might be supposed that under these
circumstances the accused is reasonably safe, but this test of guilt is not always
employed. What more commonly happens is that when several cases of unexplained sickness
have occurred in a village, with possibly one or two deaths, the people of the place
lodge a formal complaint against the supposed author of these ills, and desire that
he be punished.
</p>
<p>“Before the advent of British influence it was the practice to kill the wizard or
witch whose guilt had been established to Malay satisfaction, and such executions
were carried out not many years ago.
</p>
<p>“I remember a case in Perak less than ten years ago, when the people of an up-river
village accused a man of keeping a <i lang="ms">bâjang</i>, and the present Sultan, <span class="pageNum" id="pb324">[<a href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>who was then the principal Malay judge in the State, told them he would severely punish
the <i lang="ms">bâjang</i> if they would produce it. They went away hardly satisfied, and shortly after made
a united representation to the effect that if the person suspected were allowed to
remain in their midst they would kill him. Before anything could be done they put
him, his family, and effects on a raft and started them down the river. On their arrival
at Kuala Kangsar the man was given an isolated hut to live in, but not long afterwards
he disappeared.
</p>
<p>“The hereditary <i lang="ms">bâjang</i> comes like other evils, the unsought heritage of a dissolute ancestry, but the acquired
<i lang="ms">bâjang</i> is usually obtained from the newly-buried body of a stillborn child, which is supposed
to be the abiding-place of a familiar spirit until lured therefrom by the solicitations
of some one who, at dead of night, stands over the grave and by potent incantations
persuades the <i lang="ms">bâjang</i> to come forth.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15684src" href="#xd32e15684">5</a>
</p>
<p>“It is all very well for the Kĕdah ladies to sacrifice their shadows to obtain possession
of a <i lang="ms">pĕlsit</i>, leaders of society must be in the fashion at any cost; but there are plenty of people
living in Perak who have seen more than one ancient Malay dame taken out into the
river and, despite her protestations, her tears, and entreaties, have watched her,
with hands and feet tied, put into the water and slowly pushed down out of sight by
means of a long pole with a fork at one end which fitted on her neck. Those who have
witnessed these executions have no doubt of the justice of the punishment, and not
uncommonly add that after two or three examples had been made there would always ensue
a period of rest from the <span class="pageNum" id="pb325">[<a href="#pb325">325</a>]</span>torments of the <i lang="ms">bâjang</i>. I have also been assured that the <i lang="ms">bâjang</i>, in the shape of a lizard, has been seen to issue from the drowning person’s nose.
That statement no doubt is made on the authority of those who condemned and executed
the victim.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15703src" href="#xd32e15703">6</a>
</p>
<p>The popular superstition about the Langsuir is thus described by Sir William Maxwell:—
</p>
<p>“If a woman dies in childbirth, either before delivery or after the birth of a child,
and before the forty days of uncleanness have expired, she is popularly supposed to
become a <i lang="ms">langsuyar</i>, a flying demon of the nature of the ‘white lady’ or ‘banshee.’ To prevent this a
quantity of glass beads are put in the mouth of the corpse, a hen’s egg is put under
each arm-pit, and needles are placed in the palms of the hands. It is believed that
if this is done the dead woman cannot become a <i lang="ms">langsuyar</i>, as she cannot open her mouth to shriek (<i lang="ms">ngilai</i>) or wave her arms as wings, or open and shut her hands to assist her flight.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15720src" href="#xd32e15720">7</a>
</p>
<p>The superstitions about the Langsuir, however, do not end here, for with regard to
its origin the Selangor Malays tell the following story:—
</p>
<p>The original Langsuir (whose embodiment is supposed to be a kind of night-owl) is
described as being a woman of dazzling beauty, who died from the shock of hearing
that her child was stillborn, and had taken the shape of the Pontianak.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15737src" href="#xd32e15737">8</a> On hearing this <span class="pageNum" id="pb326">[<a href="#pb326">326</a>]</span>terrible news, she “clapped her hands,” and without further warning “flew whinnying
away to a tree, upon which she perched.” She may be known by her robe of green, by
her tapering nails of extraordinary length (a mark of beauty), and by the long jet
black tresses which she allows to fall down to her ankles—only, alas! (for the truth
must be told) in order to conceal the hole in the back of her neck through which she
sucks the blood of children! These vampire-like proclivities of hers may, however,
be successfully combated if the right means are adopted, for if you are able to catch
her, cut short her nails and luxuriant tresses, and stuff them into the hole in her
neck, she will become tame and indistinguishable from an ordinary woman, remaining
so for years. Cases have been known, indeed, in which she has become a wife and a
mother, until she was allowed to dance at a village merry-making, when she at once
reverted to her ghostly form, and flew off into the dark and gloomy forest from whence
she came.

</p>
<p>In their wild state, a Malay once informed me, these woman-vampires are exceedingly
fond of fish, and once and again may be seen “sitting in crowds on the fishing-stakes
at the river mouth awaiting an opportunity to steal the fish.” However that may be,
it seems curiously in keeping with the following charm for “laying” a Langsuir:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O ye mosquito-fry at the river’s mouth
</p>
<p class="line">When yet a great way off, ye are sharp of eye,
</p>
<p class="line">When near, ye are hard of heart.
</p>
<p class="line">When the rock in the ground opens of itself
</p>
<p class="line">Then (and then only) be emboldened the hearts of my foes and opponents!
</p>
<p class="line">When the corpse in the ground opens of itself
</p>
<p class="line">Then (and then only) be emboldened the hearts of my foes and opponents!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb327">[<a href="#pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">May your heart be softened when you behold me,
</p>
<p class="line">By grace of this prayer that I use, called Silam Bayu.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The “mosquito-fry at the river’s mouth” in the first line is no doubt intended as
an allusion to the Langsuir who frequent the fishing-stakes.
</p>
<p>The Pontianak (or Mati-anak), as has already been said, is the stillborn child of
the Langsuir, and its embodiment is like that of its mother, a kind of night-owl.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15777src" href="#xd32e15777">9</a> Curiously enough, it appears to be the only one of these spirits which rises to the
dignity of being addressed as a “Jin” or “Genie,” as appears from the charms which
are used for laying it. Thus we find in a common charm:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O Pontianak the Stillborn,
</p>
<p class="line">May you be struck dead by the soil from the grave-mound.
</p>
<p class="line">Thus (we) cut the bamboo-joints, the long and the short,
</p>
<p class="line">To cook therein the liver of the Jin (Demon) Pontianak.
</p>
<p class="line">By the grace of ‘There is no god but God,’ ” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To prevent a stillborn child from becoming a Pontianak the corpse is treated in the
same way as that of the mother, <i>i.e.</i> a hen’s egg is put under each armpit, a needle in the palm of each hand, and (probably)
glass beads or some simple equivalent in its mouth. The charm which is used on this
occasion will be found in the Appendix.
</p>
<p>The Peĕnanggalan is a sort of monstrous vampire which delights in sucking the blood
of children. The story goes that once upon a time a woman was sitting, to perform
a religious penance (<i lang="ms">dudok bĕrtapa</i>), in one of the large wooden vats which are used by the Malays for holding the vinegar
made by drawing off the sap <span class="pageNum" id="pb328">[<a href="#pb328">328</a>]</span>of the thatch-palm (<i lang="ms">mĕnyadap nipah</i>). Quite unexpectedly a man came in, and finding her sitting in the vat, asked her,
“What are you doing there?” To this the woman replied, “What business have you to
ask?” but being very much startled she attempted to escape, and in the excitement
of the moment, kicked her own chin with such force that the skin split round her neck,
and her head (with the sac of the stomach depending from it) actually became separated
from the trunk, and flew off to perch upon the nearest tree. Ever since then she has
existed as a spirit of evil, sitting on the roof-tree whinnying (<i lang="ms">mĕngilai</i>) whenever a child is born in the house, or trying to force her way up through the
floor on which the child lies, in order to drink its blood.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15808src" href="#xd32e15808">10</a>
</p>
<p>The only two spirits of this class which now remain are the Polong and the Pĕlĕsit,
and these, as I have said, partake to a great extent of the character <span class="pageNum" id="pb329">[<a href="#pb329">329</a>]</span>of familiar spirits or bottle imps, and are by no means confined to a single “rôle”
as the preceding ones have been.
</p>
<p>The Polong resembles an exceedingly diminutive female figure or mannikin, being in
point of size about as big as the top joint of the little finger. It will fly through
the air to wherever it is told to go, but is always preceded by its pet or plaything
(<i lang="ms">pĕmainan</i>), the Pĕlĕsit, which, as has already been said, appears to be a species of house-cricket.
Whenever the Polong wishes to enter (<i lang="ms">di-rasoki</i>) a new victim, it sends the Pĕlĕsit on before it, and as soon as the latter, “flying
in a headlong fashion (<i lang="ms">mĕnĕlĕntang mĕnjĕrongkong</i>),” has entered its victim’s body, which it usually does <i>tail</i>-foremost, and begins to chirp, the Polong follows. It is generally hidden away outside
the house by its owner (<i lang="ms">Jinjangan</i>), and fed with blood pricked from the finger. The description usually given of a
Polong tallies curiously with the Malay definition of the soul.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15880src" href="#xd32e15880">12</a>
</p>
<p>The last of these spirits, the Pĕlĕsit (or house-cricket?), <span class="pageNum" id="pb330">[<a href="#pb330">330</a>]</span>which is the Polong’s “plaything” or pet, flies to and fro (<i lang="ms">rasok sini</i>, <i lang="ms">rasok sana</i>) till it finds the body which its mistress has ordered it to enter, harm only being
done when it enters tail-foremost, as it generally does. It is occasionally caught
and kept in a bottle by Malay women, who feed it either on parched or saffron-stained
rice, or on blood drawn from the tip of the fourth finger which they prick for the
purpose, and who, when they wish to get rid of it, bury it in the ground. When a sick
person is affected by a Pĕlĕsit (one of the signs of which is to rave about cats)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15909src" href="#xd32e15909">13</a> the medicine-man comes and addresses the <span class="pageNum" id="pb331">[<a href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>Pĕlĕsit (or Polong?), which has taken up its residence in the patient’s body, with
the words: “Who is your mother?” To this question the Pĕlĕsit replies, speaking with
the patient’s voice, but in a high falsetto key, and giving the name of the person
who sent it, whereupon prompt measures are taken to compel the owner to recall it.
It now only remains to describe the means employed by the Malays to secure one of

<p class="first">“Go to the graveyard at night and dig up the body of a first-born child whose mother
was also first-born, and which has been dead less than forty days. On digging it up,
carry it out to an ant-hill in the open ground, and there dandle it (<i lang="ms">di-timang</i>). After a little while, when the child shrieks and lolls its tongue out (<i lang="ms">tĕrjĕlir lidah-nya</i>), bite off its tongue and carry it home. Then obtain a cocoa-nut shell from a solitary
‘green’ cocoa-nut palm (<i lang="ms">niyor hijau</i>), and carry it to a place where Three Roads Meet, light a fire and heat the shell
till oil exudes, dip the child’s tongue in the oil, and bury it in the heart of the
three cross roads (<i lang="ms">hati sempang tiga</i>). Leave it untouched for three nights, then dig it up and you will find that it has
turned into a Pĕlĕsit.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15932src" href="#xd32e15932">14</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In or about the seventh month of pregnancy (<i lang="ms">mĕngandong tujoh bulan</i>) a “Bidan”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15982src" href="#xd32e15982">15</a> (<i lang="fr">sage femme</i>) is engaged (<i lang="ms">mĕnĕmpah</i>), the ceremony being described as follows:—
</p>
<p>A copper vessel called <i lang="ms">chĕrana</i> (which is something like a fruit-dish with a stand or foot to it) is filled with
four or five peeled areca-nuts, a small block of gambier, a portion of lime (<i lang="ms">kapor sa-pĕrkaporan</i>), a “tahil” (<i lang="ms">sa-tahil</i>) of tobacco, and three or four packets (<i lang="ms">susun</i>) of betel-leaf, and carried to the Bidan’s house, where it is presented to her with
the words, “I wish to engage you for my child” (<i lang="ms">Ini’ku mahu mĕnĕmpah anak’ku</i>), or words to that effect.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16011src" href="#xd32e16011">16</a>
</p>
<p>Usually the contents of the <i lang="ms">chĕrana</i> are enclosed <span class="pageNum" id="pb333">[<a href="#pb333">333</a>]</span>in small brass receptacles, but on such occasions as the present no receptacles are
used, the usual accessories of the betel-chewing ceremony being deposited in the <i lang="ms">chĕrana</i> itself. The Bidan, on receiving the <i lang="ms">chĕrana</i>, and charming the contents, inverts it, pouring out (<i lang="ms">di-chorahkan</i>) its contents upon the floor, and taking omens for the coming event from the manner
in which they fall.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16038src" href="#xd32e16038">17</a> She then commences to chew the betel-leaf, and when she has taken as much as she
requires, she generally performs some species of divination (<i lang="ms">tengo’ dalam pĕtua</i>) in order to ascertain the nature of the child’s horoscope. This object may be achieved
in several ways; <i>e.g.</i> by astrological calculations; by casting up (<i lang="ms">palak</i> or <i lang="ms">falakiah</i>) the numerical values of the letters of both parents’ names, in accordance with the
<i lang="ms">abjad</i>, or secret cipher alphabet;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16062src" href="#xd32e16062">18</a> by observance of a wax taper fixed upon the brim of a jar of water (<i lang="ms">dian di tĕpi buyong ayer</i>); and by observance of a cup of “betel-leaf water” (<i lang="ms">ayer sirih</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16074src" href="#xd32e16074">19</a>
</p>
<p>When the time arrives the Bidan is sent for and escorted to the spot, where she points
out the luckiest place in the house for the child to be born. Such a spot must not
be under the ends of the slats of the palm-thatch, but between them, the exact spot
being discovered by repeatedly dropping the blade of a hatchet or cutlass haft downwards
into the ground below the raised floor of the house, until a spot is found wherein
it sticks and remains upright. A rattan loop (<i lang="ms">tali anggas</i>) to enable the patient to raise herself to a sitting posture, is suspended from the
rafters over <span class="pageNum" id="pb334">[<a href="#pb334">334</a>]</span>the spot selected,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16088src" href="#xd32e16088">20</a> while just exactly beneath it under the floor of the house (which is raised on piles
like the old Swiss lake-dwellings) are fastened a bunch of leaves of the prickly pandanus,
the “acid” egg-plant,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16091src" href="#xd32e16091">21</a> and a <i lang="ms">lĕkar jantan</i>, which is a kind of rattan stand used for Malay cooking-pots. The leaves of these
plants are used because it is thought that their thorns will prick any evil spirit<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16099src" href="#xd32e16099">22</a> which tries to get at the child from below, whilst the circular cooking-pot stand
will act as a noose or snare. Over the patient’s head, and just under the rafters,
is spread a casting-net (<i lang="ms">jala</i>), together with a bunch of leaves of the red dracæna (<i lang="ms">jĕnjuang</i> or <i lang="ms">lĕnjuang merah</i>) and the “acid” egg-plant.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16113src" href="#xd32e16113">23</a>
</p>
<p>A big tray (<i lang="ms">talam</i>) is now filled with a measure of uncooked husked rice (<i lang="ms">b’ras sa-gantang</i>), and covered over with a small mat of screw-palm leaves (<i lang="ms">tikar mĕngkuang</i>). This mat is in turn covered with from three to seven thicknesses of fine Malay
<i>sarongs</i> (a sort of broad plaid worn as a skirt), and these latter again are surmounted by
a second mat upon which the newly-born infant is to be deposited.
</p>
<p>The next process is the purification of mother and child by a ceremony which consists
of bathing both in warm water just not hot enough to scald the skin (<i lang="ms">ayer pĕsam-pĕsam jangan mĕlochak kulit</i>), and in which are <span class="pageNum" id="pb335">[<a href="#pb335">335</a>]</span>leaves of <i lang="ms">lĕngkuas</i>, <i lang="ms">halia</i>, <i lang="ms">kunyit t’rus</i>, <i lang="ms">kunyit</i>, <i lang="ms">pandan bau</i>, areca-palm blossom, and the dried leaves (<i lang="ms">kĕronsong</i> or <i lang="ms">kĕresek</i>) of the <i lang="ms">pisang k’lat</i>. This has to be repeated (every?) morning and evening. In most places the new-born
infant is, as has been said, laid upon a mat and formally adopted by the father, who
breathes into the child’s ear<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16167src" href="#xd32e16167">24</a> a sort of Muhammadan prayer or formula, which is called <i lang="ms">bang</i> in the case of a boy, and <i lang="ms">kamat</i> in the case of a girl. After purification the child is swaddled in a sort of papoose;
an inner bandage (<i lang="ms">barut</i>) is swathed round the child’s waist, and a broad cloth band (<i lang="ms">kain lampin</i>) is wound round its body from the knees to the breast, after which the outer bandage
(<i lang="ms">kain bĕdong</i>) is wound round the child’s body from the feet to the shoulder, and is worn continually
until the child is three or four months old, or, in Malay parlance, until he has learned
to crawl (<i lang="ms">tahu mĕniarap</i>). This contrivance, it is alleged, prevents the child from starting and straining
its muscles. Over the child’s mat is suspended a sort of small conical mosquito-net
(<i lang="ms">kain bochok</i>), the upper end of which is generally stitched (<i lang="ms">di-sĕmat</i>) or pinned on to the top of the parent’s mosquito curtain, and which is intended
to protect the child from any stray mosquito or sandfly which may have found its way
into the bigger net used by his parents.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb336">[<a href="#pb336">336</a>]</span></p>
<p>Next comes the ceremony of marking the forehead (<i lang="ms">chonting muka</i>), which is supposed to keep the child from starting and straining itself (<i lang="ms">jangan tĕrkĕjut tĕrkĕkau</i>), and from convulsions (<i lang="ms">sawan</i>), and at the same time to preserve it from evil spirits. The following are the directions:—Take
chips of wood from the thin end (<i lang="ms">kapala?</i>) of the threshold, from the steps of the house-ladder, and from the house furniture,
together with a coat (<i lang="ms">kesip</i>) of garlic, a coat of an onion, assafœtida, a rattan cooking-pot stand, and fibre
from the “monkey-face” of an unfertile cocoa-nut (<i lang="ms">tampo’ niyor jantan</i>). Burn all these articles together, collect the ashes, and mix them by means of the
fore-finger with a little “betel-water.”
</p>
<p>Now repeat the proper charm,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16262src" href="#xd32e16262">25</a> dip the finger in the mixture, and mark the centre of the child’s forehead, if a
boy with a sign resembling what is called a bench mark <span class="figure triviwidth"><img src="images/tri-vi.png" alt="[V]" width="11" height="14"></span>, if a girl with a plain cross +, and at the same time put small daubs on the nose,
cheeks, chin, and shoulders. Then mark the mother with a line drawn from breast to
breast (<i lang="ms">pangkah susu</i>) and a daub on the end of the nose (<i lang="ms">cholek hidong</i>). If you do this properly, a Langat Malay informed me, the Evil One will take mother
and child for his own wife and child (who are supposed to be similarly marked) and
will consequently refrain from harming them!
</p>
<p>In addition to the above, if the child is a girl, her eyebrows are shaved and a curve
drawn in their place, extending from the root of the nose to the ear (<i lang="ms">di-pantiskan bĕntok taji dĕri muka sampei pĕlipis</i>). The mixture used for marking these curves consists of <i lang="ms">manjakani</i> mixed with milk from the mother’s breast.
</p>
<p>Another most curious custom which recalls a parallel <span class="pageNum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>custom among North American Indians, is occasionally resorted to for the purpose of
altering the shape of the child’s head. When it is considered too long (<i lang="ms">tĕrlampau panjang</i>), a small tightly-fitting “yam leaf cap” (<i lang="ms">songko’ daun k’ladi</i>), consisting of seven thicknesses of calladium (yam) leaves is used to compress it.
This operation is supposed to shorten the child’s skull, and the person who fits it
on to the child’s head uses the words—“Muhammad, short be your head” in the case of
a boy, and “Fatimah, short be your head” in the case of a girl.
</p>
<p>Now comes the ceremony of administering to the infant what is called the “mouth-opener”
(lit. “mouth-splitter,” <i lang="ms">pĕmb’lah mulut</i>); first, you take a green cocoa-nut (<i lang="ms">niyor sungkoran</i>), split it in halves (<i lang="ms">di-b’lah niyor</i>), put a “grain” of salt inside one-half of the shell (<i lang="ms">di-buboh garam sa-buku</i>), and give it to the child to drink, counting up to seven, and putting it to the
child’s mouth at the word seven (<i lang="ms">lĕtakkan di mulut-nya</i>). Then repeat the ceremony, substituting <i lang="ms">asam</i> (tamarinds?) for the salt. Finally, take a gold ring, and after rubbing it against
the inside of the cocoa-nut (<i lang="ms">cholek di-dalam niyor</i>), lay it upon the child’s lips, (<i lang="ms">lĕtakkan di bibir-nya</i>), saying “Bismillah,” etc. Do the same with a silver and amalgam (gold and silver)
ring respectively, and the ceremony will be at an end.
</p>
<p>I may note, in passing, that it is in allusion to the above ceremony that you will
sometimes hear old men say “It’s not the first time I tasted salt, I did so ever since
I was first put into my swinging-cot” (<i lang="ms">aku makan garam dahulu, dĕripada tatkala naik buayan</i>).
</p>
<p>Sometimes a little “rock” sugar (<i lang="ms">gula batu</i>) is added to make the “mouth-opener” more palatable.
</p>
<p>From the time when the child is about twenty-four <span class="pageNum" id="pb338">[<a href="#pb338">338</a>]</span>hours old until it is of the age of three months, it is fed with rice boiled in a
pot on the fire, “broken” (<i lang="ms">di-lechek</i>) by means of a short broad cocoa-nut shell spoon (<i lang="ms">pĕlechek</i>), mixed with a little sugar and squeezed into small receptacles of woven cocoa-nut
leaf (<i lang="ms">kĕtupat</i>).
</p>
<p>Later it is taught to feed at the breast (<i lang="ms">mĕnetek</i>), which continues until it is weaned by the application of bitter aloes (<i lang="ms">jadam</i>) to the mother’s breasts.
</p>
<p>In the rice-jar (<i lang="ms">buyong b’ras</i>) during this period, a stone, a big iron nail, and a “candle-nut” must be kept, and
a spoon (<i lang="ms">sĕndok</i>) must always be used for putting the rice into the pot before boiling it. Moreover,
the mother, when eating or drinking, must always cross her left arm under her breasts
(<i lang="ms">di-ampu susu-nya di lĕngan kiri</i>) leaving the right arm free to bring the food to the mouth.
</p>
<p>When the child has been bathed, it is fumigated, and deposited for the first time
in a swinging-cot (the Malay substitute for a cradle) which, according to immemorial
custom, is formed by a <i>black</i> cloth slung from one of the rafters. To fumigate<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16370src" href="#xd32e16370">26</a> it you take leaves of the red dracæna (<i lang="ms">jĕnjuang merah</i>), and wrap them round first with the casing of the charred torch (<i lang="ms">puntong</i>) used at the severing of the cord (<i lang="ms">pĕmbuang <span class="pageNum" id="pb339">[<a href="#pb339">339</a>]</span>tali pusat</i>), then with leaves of the <i lang="ms">t’rong asam</i> (“acid” egg-plant), and tie them round at intervals with a string of shredded tree-bark
(<i lang="ms">tali t’rap</i>). The funnel-shaped bouquet thus formed is suspended above the child’s cot (<i lang="ms">buayan</i>); a spice-block (<i lang="ms">batu giling</i>) is deposited inside it, and underneath it are placed the naked blade of a cutlass
(<i lang="ms">parang puting</i>), a cocoa-nut scraper (<i lang="ms">kukoran</i>), and one of the basket-work stands used for the cooking-pots (<i lang="ms">lĕkar jantan</i>), which latter is slung round the neck of the cocoa-nut scraper. This last strange
contrivance is, I believe, intended as a hint to the evil spirit or vampire which
comes to suck the child’s blood, and for whom the trap described above is set underneath
the house-floor.
</p>
<p>Now get a censer and burn incense in it, adding to the flame, as it burns, rubbish
from beneath a deserted house, the deserted nest of a <i lang="ms">mĕr’bah</i> (dove), and the deserted nest of the “rain-bird” (<i lang="ms">sarang burong ujan-ujan</i>). When all is ready, rock the cot very gently seven times, then take the spice-block
out of the cot and deposit it together with the blade of the cutlass upon the ground,
take the child in your arms and fumigate it by moving it thrice round in a circle
over the smoke of the censer, counting up to seven as you do so, and swing the child
gently towards your left. At the word “seven” call the child’s soul by saying “Cluck,
cluck! soul of Muhammad here!”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16439src" href="#xd32e16439">27</a> (if it is a boy), or “Cluck, cluck! soul of Fatimah here!” (if it is a girl); deposit
the child in the cot and rock it very gently, so that it does not swing farther than
the neck of the cocoa-nut scraper extends (<i lang="ms">sa-panjang kukoran sahaja</i>). After this you may swing it as far as you <span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span>like, but for at least seven days afterwards, whenever the child is taken out of the
cot, the spice-block, or stone-child (<i lang="ms">anak batu</i>) as it is called, must be deposited in the cot as a substitute for the child (<i lang="ms">pĕngganti budak</i>).
</p>
<p>Once in every four hours the child should be bathed with cold water, in order that
it may be kept “cool.” This custom, I was told, is diametrically opposite to that
which obtains at Malacca, where the child is bathed as rarely as possible. The custom
followed in Selangor is said to prevent the child from getting a sore mouth (<i lang="ms">guam</i>).
</p>
<p>For the first two months or so, whenever the child is bathed, it is rubbed over with
a paste obtained by mixing powdered rice with the powder obtained from a red stone
called <i lang="ms">batu kawi</i>. This stone, which is said by some Malays to take its name from the Island of Langkawi,
is thought to possess astringent (<i lang="ms">k’lat</i>) qualities, and is used by Malay women to improve their skin. Before use the paste
is fumigated with the smoke of burning eagle-wood, sandal-wood, and incense, after
which the liquid, which is said to resemble red ink, is applied to the skin, and then
washed off, no doubt, with lime-juice in the ordinary way.
</p>
<p>In the cold water which is used for bathing the child are deposited a big iron nail
(as a “symbol of iron”), “candle-nuts” and cockle-shells (<i lang="ms">kulit k’rang</i>), to which some Malays add a kind of parasite called <i lang="ms">si bĕr’nas</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Well-Filled Out, a word applied to children who are fat, instead of the word <i lang="ms">gĕmok</i>, which is considered unlucky) and another parasite called <i lang="ms">sadingin</i> or <i lang="ms">si dingin</i>, the “Cold” one.
</p>
<p>After bathing, the Bidan should perform the ceremony called <i lang="ms">sĕmbor sirih</i>, which consists in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb341">[<a href="#pb341">341</a>]</span>ejecting of betel-leaf (mixed with other ingredients) out of her mouth on to the pit
of the child’s stomach, the ingredients being pounded leaves of the <i lang="ms">bunglei</i>, <i lang="ms">chĕkor</i>, and <i lang="ms">jĕrangau</i>, and chips of brazil-wood, ebony, and sugar-palm twigs (<i lang="ms">sĕgar kabong</i>); to these are sometimes added small portions of the “Rough” bamboo (<i lang="ms">buluh kasap</i>), of the <i lang="ms">bĕmban balu</i>, and of the leaf-cases of the areca-palm (either <i lang="ms">upih b’lah batang</i> or <i lang="ms">upih sarong</i>).
</p>
<p>The child is generally named within the first week, but I have not yet heard of any
special ceremony connected with the naming, though it is most probably considered
as a religious act. The name is evidently considered of some importance, for if the
child happens to get ill directly after the naming, it is sometimes re-adopted (temporarily)
by a third party, who gives it a different name. When this happens a species of bracelets
and anklets made of black cloth are put upon the child’s wrists and ankles, the ceremony
being called <i lang="ms">tumpang sayang</i>.
</p>
<p>A few days later the child’s head is shaved, and his nails cut for the first time.
For the former process a red lather is manufactured from fine rice-flour mixed with
gambier, lime, and betel-leaf. Some people have the child’s head shaved clean, others
leave the central lock (<i lang="ms">jambul</i>). In either case the remains of the red lather, together with the clippings of hair
(and nails?) are received in a rolled-up yam-leaf (<i lang="ms">daun k’ladi di-ponjut</i>) or cocoa-nut (?), and carried away and deposited at the foot of a shady tree, such
as a banana (or a pomegranate?).
</p>
<p>Sometimes (as had been done in the case of a Malay bride at whose “tonsure” I assisted<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16536src" href="#xd32e16536">28</a>), the parents <span class="pageNum" id="pb342">[<a href="#pb342">342</a>]</span>make a vow at a child’s birth that they will give a feast at the tonsure of its hair,
just before its marriage, provided the child grows up in safety.
</p>
<p>Occasionally the ceremony of shaving the child’s head takes place on the 44th day
after birth, the ceremony being called <i lang="ms">balik juru</i>. A small sum, such as $2.00 or $3.00, is also sometimes presented to a pilgrim to
carry clippings of the child’s locks to Mecca and cast them into the well Zemzem,
such payment being called <i lang="ms">’kêkah</i> (<i lang="ms">ʿakêkah</i>) in the case of a boy, and <i lang="ms">kĕrban</i> in the case of a girl.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16558src" href="#xd32e16558">29</a>
</p>
<p>To return to the mother. She is bathed in hot water at 8 o’clock each morning for
three days, and from the day of birth (after ablution) she has to undergo the strangest
ceremony of all, “ascending the roasting-place” (<i lang="ms">naik saleian</i>). A kind of rough couch is prepared upon a small platform (<i lang="ms">saleian</i>), which is about six feet in length, and slopes downwards towards the foot, where
it is about two feet above the floor. Beneath this platform a fireplace or hearth
(<i lang="ms">dapor</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16579src" href="#xd32e16579">30</a> is constructed, and a “roaring fire” lighted, which is <span class="pageNum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span>intended to warm the patient to a degree consistent with Malay ideas of what is beneficial!
Custom, which is stronger than law, forces the patient to recline upon this couch
two or three times in the course of the day, and to remain upon it each time for an
hour or two. To such extremes is this practice carried, that “on one occasion a poor
woman was brought to the point of death … and would have died if she had not been
rescued by the kind interposition of the Civil Assistant-Surgeon; the excessive excitement
caused by the heat was so overpowering that aberration of mind ensued which continued
for several months.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16604src" href="#xd32e16604">31</a>
</p>
<p>As if this were not enough, one of the heated hearth-stones (<i lang="ms">batu tungku</i>) is frequently wrapped up in a piece of flannel or old rags, applied to the patient’s
stomach so as to “roast” her still more effectually. This “roasting” custom is said
to continue for the whole of the forty-four days of uncleanness. During this period
there are many birth-taboos (<i lang="ms">pantang bĕranak</i>) applying to food, the following articles being usually forbidden: (1) things which
have (from the Malay point of view) a lowering effect on the constitution (<i lang="ms">sagala yang sĕjuk-sĕjuk</i>), <i>e.g.</i> fruits, with some exceptions, and vegetables; (2) things which have a heating effect
on the blood (<i lang="ms">sagala yang bisa-bisa</i>), <i>e.g.</i> the fish called <i lang="ms">pari</i> (skate), the Prickly Fish (<i lang="ms">ikan duri</i>), and the <i lang="ms">sĕmbilang</i> (a kind of mudfish <span class="pageNum" id="pb344">[<a href="#pb344">344</a>]</span>with poisonous spines on both sides and back), and all fresh-water fish; (3) all things
which have an irritating effect on the skin (<i lang="ms">sagala yang gatal-gatal</i>), <i>e.g.</i> the fish called <i lang="ms">tĕnggiri</i>, and <i lang="ms">tĕrubok</i>, shell-fish, and the egg-plant or Brinjal, while the fish called <i lang="ms">kurau</i>, <i lang="ms">g’lama</i>, <i lang="ms">sĕnahong</i>, <i lang="ms">parang-parang</i> may be eaten, so long as they are well salted; (4) things which are supposed to cause
faintness (<i lang="ms">sagala yang bĕntan-bĕntan</i>), or swooning (<i lang="ms">pengsan</i>), such, for instance, as uncooked cocoa-nut pulp, gourds and cucumbers; (5) sugar
(with the exception of cocoa-nut sugar), cocoa-nuts, and chillies.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16676src" href="#xd32e16676">32</a>
</p>
<p>The following description of birth-taboos in Pahang, taken from Mr. H. Clifford’s
<i>Studies in Brown Humanity</i>, will give a good general idea of this part of the subject:—
</p>
<p>“When Umat has placed the <i lang="ms">sîrih</i> leaves he has done all he can for Sĕlĕma, and he resigns himself to endure the anxiety
of the next few months with the patience of which he has so much command. The <i lang="ms">pantang bĕr-ânak</i>, or birth-taboos, hem a husband in almost as rigidly as they do his wife, and Umat,
who is as superstitious as are all the Malays of the lower classes, is filled with
fear lest he should unwittingly transgress any law, the breach of which might cost
Sĕlĕma her life. He no longer shaves his head periodically, as he loves to do, for
a naked scalp is very cool and comfortable; he does not even cut his <span class="pageNum" id="pb345">[<a href="#pb345">345</a>]</span>hair, and a thick black shock stands five inches high upon his head, and tumbles raggedly
about his neck and ears. Sĕlĕma is his first wife, and never before has she borne
children, wherefore no hair of her husband’s must be trimmed until her days are accomplished.
Umat will not kill the fowls for the cook now, nor even drive a stray dog from the
compound with violence, lest he should chance to maim it, for he must shed no blood,
and must do no hurt to any living thing during all this time. One day he is sent on
an errand up-river and is absent until the third day. On inquiry it appears that he
passed the night in a friend’s house, and on the morrow found that the wife of his
host was shortly expecting to become a mother. Therefore he had to remain at least
two nights in the village. Why? Because if he failed to do so, Sĕlĕma would die. Why
would she die? God alone knows, but such is the teaching of the men of old, the wise
ones of ancient days. But Umat’s chief privation is that he is forbidden to sit in
the doorway of his house. To understand what this means to a Malay, you must realise
that the seat in the doorway, at the head of the stair-ladder that reaches to the
ground, is to him much what the fireside is to the English peasant. It is here that
he sits and looks out patiently at life, as the European gazes into the heart of the
fire. It is here that his neighbours come to gossip with him, and it is in the doorway
of his own or his friend’s house that the echo of the world is borne to his ears.
But, while Sĕlĕma is ill, Umat may not block the doorway, or dreadful consequences
will ensue, and though he appreciates this and makes the sacrifice readily for his
wife’s sake, it takes much of the comfort out of his life.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb346">[<a href="#pb346">346</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Sĕlĕma, meanwhile, has to be equally circumspect. She bridles her woman’s tongue
resolutely, and no word in disparagement of man or beast passes her lips during all
these months, for she has no desire to see the qualities she dislikes reproduced in
the child. She is often tired to death and faint and ill before her hour draws nigh,
but none the less she will not lie upon her mat during the daytime lest her heavy
eyes should close in sleep, since her child would surely fall a prey to evil spirits
were she to do so. Therefore she fights on to the dusk, and Umat does all he can to
comfort her and to lighten her sufferings by constant tenderness and care.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16716src" href="#xd32e16716">33</a>
</p>
<p>The medicine (<i lang="ms">sambaran bara</i>), used by the mother after her confinement, consists of the ashes of a burnt cocoa-nut
shell pounded and mixed with a pinch of black pepper (<i lang="ms">lada hitam sa-jimput</i>), a root of garlic (<i lang="ms">bawang puteh sa-labuh</i>), and enough vinegar to make the mixture liquid. This potion is drunk for three consecutive
mornings. A bandage is swathed about her waist, and she is treated with a cosmetic
(<i lang="ms">bĕdak</i>) manufactured from <i lang="ms">tĕmu kuning</i>, which is pounded small (and mixed as before with garlic, black pepper, and vinegar),
and applied every morning and evening for the first three days. During the next three
days a new cosmetic (<i lang="ms">bĕdak kunyit t’rus</i>) is applied, the ingredients being <i lang="ms">kunyit t’rus</i> pounded and mixed in the same way as the cosmetic just described.
</p>
<p>At the same time the patient is given a potion made from the ash of burnt durian skins
(<i lang="ms">abu kulit durian</i>), mixed as before with vinegar; the fruit-stalk, <span class="pageNum" id="pb347">[<a href="#pb347">347</a>]</span>or “spire,” of a cocoa-nut palm (<i lang="ms">manggar niyor</i>) being substituted if the durian skin is not obtainable.
</p>
<p>A poultice (<i lang="ms">ubat pupok</i>) is also applied to the patient’s forehead, after the early bathing, during the “forty-four
days” of her retirement; it consists of leaves of the <i lang="ms">tahi babi</i>, <i lang="ms">jintan hitam</i>, and garlic, pounded and mixed as usual with vinegar.
</p>
<p>After three days an extraordinary mixture, called in Selangor the “Hundred Herbs”
(<i lang="ms">rĕmpah ’ratus</i>), but in Malacca merely “Pot-herbs” (<i lang="ms">rĕmpah p’riok</i>), is concocted from all kinds of herbs, roots, and spices. The ingredients are put
into a large vessel of water and left to soak, a portion of the liquor being strained
off and given to the patient as a potion every morning for about ten days. Similar
ingredients boiled in a large pot, which is kept hot by being hermetically sealed
(<i lang="ms">di-gĕtang</i>), and by having live embers placed underneath it from time to time, furnish the regular
beverage of the patient up to the time of her purification. After the first fortnight,
however, the lees are extracted from the vessel and used to compose a poultice which
is applied to the patient’s waist, a set of fresh ingredients replacing the old ones.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16778src" href="#xd32e16778">34</a> It is sold for fifty cents a jar.
</p>
<p>On the forty-fourth day the raised platform or roasting-place (<i lang="ms">saleian</i>) is taken down and the ceremony called Floor-washing (<i lang="ms">basoh lantei</i>) takes place, the whole house being thoroughly washed and cleaned. <span class="pageNum" id="pb348">[<a href="#pb348">348</a>]</span>The floor having been smeared with rice-cosmetic (<i lang="ms">bĕdak</i>) (such as the Malays use for the bathing ceremony), it is well scratched by the claws
of a fowl, which is caught (and washed) for the purpose, and then held over the floor
and forced to do the scratching required of it. The cosmetic is then removed (<i lang="ms">di-langir</i>) by means of lime-juice (again as in the bathing ceremony) and the hearth-fire is
changed. The Bidan now receives her pay, usually getting in cash for the eldest child
$4.40 (in some places $5.40), for the second, $3.40, the third, $2.40, and for the
fourth, and all subsequent children, $1.40; unless she is hastily summoned (<i lang="ms">bidan tarek</i>) and no engagement (<i lang="ms">mĕnĕmpah</i>) has been made, in which case she may demand half a <i lang="ms">bhara</i> ($11). Besides this somewhat meagre remuneration, however, she receives from the
well-to-do (at the floor-washing ceremony) such presents as cast-off clothes (<i lang="ms">kain bĕkas tuboh</i>), a bowl of saffron rice, a bowl of the rice-cosmetic and limes (<i lang="ms">bĕdak limau</i>), and a platter of betel-leaf, with accessories (<i lang="ms">chĕrana sirih</i>). Though the remuneration may appear small, it was, nevertheless, sure; as in former
days an unwritten law allowed her to take the child and “cry it for sale” (<i lang="ms">di-jaja</i>) round the country, should her fee remain unpaid.
</p>
<p>Before concluding the present subject it will be necessary to describe certain specific
injunctions and taboos which form an important part of the vast body of Malay customs
which centre specially round the birth of children.
</p>
<p>Before the child is born the father has to be more than usually circumspect with regard
to what he does, as any untoward act on his part would assuredly have <span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span>a prejudicial effect on the child, and cause a birth-mark or even actual deformity,
any such affection being called <i lang="ms">kĕnan</i>. In a case which came to my notice the son was born with only a thumb, forefinger,
and little finger on the left hand, and a great toe on the left foot, the rest of
the fingers and toes on the left side being wanting. This, I was told, was due to
the fact that the father violated this taboo by going to the fishing-stakes one day
and killing a crab by chopping at it with a cutlass.
</p>
<p>In former days during this period it was “taboo” (<i lang="ms">pantang</i>) for the father to cut the throat of a buffalo or even of a fowl; or, in fact, to
take the life of any animal whatever—a trace no doubt of Indian influences. A Malay
told me once that his son, soon after birth, was afflicted with a great obstruction
of breathing, but that when the medicine-man (<i lang="ms">Pawang</i>) declared (after “diagnosing” the case) that the child was suffering from a “fish-affection”
(<i lang="ms">kĕnan ikan</i>), he remembered that he had knocked on the head an extraordinary number of fish which
he had caught on the very day that his son was born. He therefore, by the advice of
the medicine-man, gave the child a potion made from pounded fish bones, and an immediate
and permanent recovery was the result.
</p>
<p>Such affections as those described are classified by the Malays according to the kind
of influence which is supposed to have produced them. Thus the unoffending victim
may be either fish-struck (<i lang="ms">kĕnan ikan</i>), as described above, ape-struck (<i lang="ms">kĕnan b’rok</i>), dog-struck (<i lang="ms">kĕnan anjing</i>), crab-struck (<i lang="ms">kĕnan kĕtam</i>), and so forth, it being maintained that in every case the child either displays
some physical deformity, causing a resemblance to the animal by <span class="pageNum" id="pb350">[<a href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>which it was affected, or else (and more commonly) unconsciously imitates its actions
or its “voice.”
</p>
<p>Another interesting custom was that the father was stringently forbidden to cut his
hair until after the birth of the child.
</p>
<p>The following passage bearing on the subject is taken from Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell’s article
on the “Folklore of the Malays”:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16962src" href="#xd32e16962">35</a>—
</p>
<p>“In selecting timber for the uprights of a Malay house care must be taken to reject
any log which is indented by the pressure of any parasitic creeper which may have
wound round it when it was a living tree. A log so marked, if used in building a house,
will exercise an unfavourable influence in childbirth, protracting delivery and endangering
the lives of mother and child. Many precautions must be taken to guard against evil
influence of a similar kind, when one of the inmates of a house is expecting to become
a mother. No one may ‘divide the house’ (<i lang="ms">bĕlah rumah</i>), that is, go in at the front door and out at the back, or <i>vice versâ</i>, nor may any guest or stranger be entertained in the house for one night only; he
must be detained for a second night to complete an even period. If an eclipse <span class="corr" id="xd32e16975" title="Source: occur">occurs</span>, the woman on whose account these observances are necessary must be taken into the
<i lang="ms">pĕnangga</i> (kitchen), and placed beneath the shelf or platform (<i lang="ms">para</i>) on which the domestic utensils are kept. A spoon is put into her hand. If these
precautions are not taken, the child when born will be deformed.”
</p>
<p>Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell in the above is speaking of Perak Malays. The passage just quoted
applies to a <span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>great extent to Selangor, but with a few discrepancies. Thus a house-post indented
by a creeper is generally avoided in Selangor for a different reason, viz. that it
is supposed to bring snakes into the house.
</p>
<p>“Dividing the house,” however, is generally considered an important birth-taboo in
Selangor, the threatened penalty for its non-observance being averted by compelling
the guilty party to submit to the unpleasant ceremony called <i lang="ms">sĕmbor ayer</i>, a member of the family being required to eject (<i lang="ms">sĕmbor</i>) a mouthful of water upon the small of the culprit’s back.
</p>
<p>In Selangor, again, a guest must stay <i>three</i> nights (not <i>two</i>) in the house, his departure on the first or second night being called “Insulting
the Night” (<i lang="ms">mĕnjolok malam</i>). To avert the evil consequences of such an act, fumigation (<i lang="ms">rabun-rabun</i>) is resorted to, the “recipe” for it running as follows:—“Take assafœtida, sulphur,
<i lang="ms">kunyit t’rus</i> (an evil-smelling root), onion skins, dried areca-nut husk, lemon-grass leaves, and
an old mat or cloth, burn them, and leave the ashes for about an hour at sunset on
the floor of the passage in front of the door.” That a sensible and self-respecting
“demon” should avoid a house where such an unconscionable odour is raised is not in
the least surprising!
</p>
<p>In the event of an eclipse the customs of the two sister States appear to be nearly
identical; the only difference being that in Selangor the woman is placed in the doorway
(in the moonlight as far as possible), and is furnished with the basket-work stand
of a cooking pot, as well as a wooden rice-spoon, the former as a trap to catch any
unwary demon who may be so foolish as to put his head “into the noose,” and the latter
as a weapon of offence, it being supposed that “the <span class="pageNum" id="pb352">[<a href="#pb352">352</a>]</span>rattan binding of the spoon (which must, of course, be of the orthodox Malay pattern)
will unwind itself and entangle the assailant” in the case of any real danger. Finally,
the Bidan must be present to “massage” the woman, and repeat the necessary charms.
</p>
<p>From the following passage it would appear that the corresponding Pahang custom does
not materially differ from that of Perak and Selangor:—
</p>
<p>“But during the period that the Moon’s fate hung in the balance, Sĕlĕma has suffered
many things. She has been seated motionless in the fireplace under the tray-like shelf,
which hangs from the low rafters, trembling with terror of—she knows not what. The
little basket-work stand, on which the hot rice-pot is wont to rest, is worn on her
head as a cap, and in her girdle the long wooden rice-spoon is stuck dagger-wise.
Neither she nor Umat know why these things are done, but they never dream of questioning
their necessity. It is the custom. The men of olden days have decreed that women with
child should do these things when the Moon is in trouble, and the consequences of
neglect are too terrible to be risked; so Sĕlĕma and Umat act according to their simple
faith.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17019src" href="#xd32e17019">36</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the purely Malay ceremonies performed at Adolescence, the most important are the
“filing of the teeth” (<i lang="ms">bĕrasah gigi</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17034src" href="#xd32e17034">37</a> and the cutting of the first locks of hair, in cases where this latter operation
has been postponed till the child’s marriage by a vow of its parents.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb353">[<a href="#pb353">353</a>]</span></p>
<p>The following is a description of the rite of tonsure (<i lang="ms">bĕrchukor</i>), at which I was present in person:—
</p>
<p>“Some time ago (in 1897) I received, through one of my local Malay headmen, an invitation
to attend a tonsure ceremony.
</p>
<p>“When I arrived (about two <span class="sc">P.M.</span>), in company of the headman referred to, the usual dancing and Korān-chanting was
proceeding in the outer chamber or verandah, which was decked out for the occasion
with the usual brilliantly coloured ceiling-cloth and striped wall-tapestry. After
a short interval we were invited to enter an inner room, where a number of Malays
of both sexes were awaiting the performance of the rite. The first thing, however,
that caught the eye was a gracefully-draped figure standing with shrouded head, and
with its back to the company, upon the lowest step of the dais (<i lang="ms">g’rei</i>), which had been erected with a view to the prospective wedding ceremony. This was
the bride. A dark-coloured veil, thrown over her head and shoulders, allowed seven
luxuriant tresses of her wonderful raven-black hair to escape and roll down below
her waist, a ring of precious metal being attached to the end of each tress. Close
to the bride, and ready to support her, should she require it, in her motherly arms,
stood the (on such occasions) familiar figure of the Duenna (<i lang="ms">Mak Inang</i>), whose duty, however, in the present instance was confined to taking the left hand
of the bride between her own, and supporting it in a horizontal position whilst each
of the seven Representatives (<i lang="ms">orang waris</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17060src" href="#xd32e17060">38</a> in turn was sprinkling it with the ‘Neutralising Rice-paste’ (<i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>) by means of the usual bunch <span class="pageNum" id="pb354">[<a href="#pb354">354</a>]</span>or brush of leaves. A little in front of this pair stood a youth supporting in his
hands an unhusked cocoa-nut shell. The crown of this cocoa-nut had been removed, and
the edges at the top cut in such a way as to form a chevroned or ‘dog-tooth’ border.
Upon the indentations of this rim was deposited a necklace, and a large pair of scissors
about the size of a tailor’s shears were stuck point downwards in the rim. The cocoa-nut
itself was perhaps half-filled with its ‘milk.’ Close to this youth stood another,
supporting one of the usual circular brass trays (with high sides) containing all
the ordinary accessories of the <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i> ceremony, <i>i.e.</i> a bowl of rice-paste, a brush of leaves, parched rice, washed saffron-stained rice,
and benzoin or incense.
</p>
<p>“I was now requested to open the proceedings, but at my express desire the Pĕnghulu
(Malay headman) did so for me, first scattering several handfuls (of the different
sorts of rice) over the bride, and then sprinkling the rice-paste upon the palm of
her left hand, which was held out to receive it as described above. The sprinkling
over, he took the scissors and with great deliberation severed the end of the first
lock, which was made to fall with a little splash, and with the ring attached to it,
into the cocoa-nut with the ‘dog-tooth’ border.
</p>
<p>“Five other <i lang="ms">waris</i> (Representatives) and myself followed suit, the seven tresses with the rings attached
to them being all received in the cocoa-nut as described.
</p>
<p>“A child of the age of about two or three years underwent the tonsure at the same
time, each of the Representatives, after severing the bride’s lock, snipping off a
portion of the child’s hair. The child was in arms and was not veiled, but wore a
shoulder-cloth <span class="pageNum" id="pb355">[<a href="#pb355">355</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">bidak</i>) thrown over his shoulder. At the conclusion of the ceremony we left the room, and
the Korān-chanting was resumed and continued until the arrival of the bridegroom in
procession (at about five <span class="sc">P.M.</span>), when the bride and bridegroom went through the ceremony of being ‘seated side by
side’ (<i lang="ms">bĕrsanding</i>), and the business of the day was concluded.
</p>
<p>“The cocoa-nut containing the severed tresses and rings is carried to the foot of
a barren fruit-tree (<i>e.g.</i> a pomegranate-tree), when the rings are extracted and the water (with the severed
locks) poured out at the tree’s foot, the belief being that this proceeding will <i>make the tree as luxuriant as the hair of the person shorn</i>, a very clear example of ‘sympathetic magic.’ If the parents are poor, the cocoa-nut
is generally turned upside down and left there; but if they are well-to-do, the locks
are usually sent to Mecca in charge of a pilgrim, who casts them on his arrival into
the well Zemzem.”
</p>
<p>I will now describe the ceremony of filing or “sharpening” the teeth, from notes taken
by myself during the actual ceremony (20th March, 1897).
</p>
<p>The youth whose teeth I saw filed must have been quite fifteen or sixteen years of
age, and had not long before undergone the rite of circumcision. When I arrived I
found the house newly swept and clean, and all the accessories of the ceremony already
prepared. These latter consisted of a round tray (<i lang="ms">dulang</i>) containing the usual bowl of rice-paste (<i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>), with the brush of leaves,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17111src" href="#xd32e17111">39</a> three cups (containing different sorts of rice), an egg,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17133src" href="#xd32e17133">40</a> three rings <span class="pageNum" id="pb356">[<a href="#pb356">356</a>]</span>of precious metals (gold, silver, and amalgam), a couple of limes, and two small files
(to which a small tooth-saw and two small whetstones should be added).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17147src" href="#xd32e17147">41</a>
</p>
<p>The ceremony now commences: the tooth-filer (<i lang="ms">Pawang gigi</i>) first scatters the three sorts of rice and sprinkles the <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i> upon his instruments, etc., repeating the proper charm<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17187src" href="#xd32e17187">42</a> at the same time; the patient meanwhile, and throughout the operation, reclining
upon his back on the floor with his head resting on a pillow. Next the Pawang, sitting
beside the patient, “touches” the patient’s teeth, first with each of the three rings
of precious metal and then with the egg, throwing each of these objects away as he
does so, and repeating each time a charm (<i lang="ms">Hu, kata Allah, d. s. b.</i>), which is given in the Appendix. Next he props open (<i lang="ms">di-sĕngkang</i>) the patient’s mouth by means of a dried areca-nut, and repeats another charm (<i lang="ms">Hei, Bismi</i>) in order to destroy the “venom” of the steel, laying the file upon the teeth,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17204src" href="#xd32e17204">43</a> and drawing it thrice across them at the end of the charm. He then cuts off (<i lang="ms">di-k’rat</i>) the crowns of the teeth (with one <span class="pageNum" id="pb357">[<a href="#pb357">357</a>]</span>of the files), smooths their edges (<i lang="ms">di-papar</i>) with one of the whetstones, and polishes them (<i lang="ms">mĕlechek</i>). During the whole of this part of the performance, which is a trying ordeal to witness,
although it is borne with the utmost fortitude on the part of the sufferer, the latter
holds a small mirror in front of his mouth in order to be assured that the operation
is progressing to his satisfaction. When the actual filing is over, the areca-nut
is extracted, and a piece of cocoa-nut husk or small block of <i lang="ms">pulai</i> wood inserted in its stead, in order to facilitate the proper polishing of the now
mutilated teeth. This latter part of the operation is accomplished by means of the
file, a small piece of folded white cloth protecting the lips from injury.
</p>
<p>Considerable interest attaches to the filing of the first tooth, on account of the
omens which are taken from the position in which the crown happens to lie when it
falls. If, when the tooth is filed through, the crown adheres to the file, it is taken
as a sign that the patient will die at home; if it flies off and lies with its edge
turned upwards, this means, on the contrary, that he will die abroad.
</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the operation a species of poultice (<i lang="ms">ubat tasak</i>), consisting mainly of cooked ginger (<i lang="ms">halia bara di-pahis-ki</i>), which is intended to “deaden (the feeling of) the gums” (<i lang="ms">matikan daging gusi</i>) is duly charmed<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17238src" href="#xd32e17238">44</a> and applied to the gums of the jaw which happens to be under treatment. The Pawang
now lays one hand (the left) on the top of the patient’s head and the other upon the
teeth of the upper jaw, and presses them together with a show of considerable force,
making believe, as it were, that <span class="pageNum" id="pb358">[<a href="#pb358">358</a>]</span>he is pressing the patient’s upper teeth firmly into their sockets. Finally, a portion
of betel-leaf is charmed (with the charm <i lang="ms">Hong sarangin</i>, etc.) and given to the patient to chew, after which, it is asserted, all pain immediately
ceases. The Pawang then washes his hands, resharpens his tools, and those present
sit down to a meal of saffron-stained <i lang="ms">pulut</i> rice. This concludes the ceremony for the day, the lower jaw being similarly treated
upon a subsequent occasion.
</p>
<p>In the course of three such operations (the Pawang informed me) the teeth can be filed
down even with the gums, in which case they are, I believe, in some instances somewhat
roughly plated or cased with gold. Sometimes, however, they are merely filed into
points, so that they resemble the teeth of a shark.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17256src" href="#xd32e17256">45</a> Very frequently, too, they blacken them with a mixture of the empyreumatic oil of
the cocoa-nut shell (<i lang="ms">baja</i> or <i lang="ms">g’rang</i>) and <i lang="ms">kamunting</i> (Kl. <i lang="ms">karamunting</i>) wood,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17274src" href="#xd32e17274">46</a> which is also used for blackening the eyebrows. These customs, however, are already
dying out in the more civilised Malay States.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb359">[<a href="#pb359">359</a>]</span></p>
<p>Whenever I made inquiries as to the reason of this strange custom, I was invariably
told that it not only beautified but preserved the teeth from the action of decay,
which the Malays believe to be set up by the presence of a minute maggot or worm (<i lang="ms">ulat</i>), their most usual way of expressing the fact that they are suffering from toothache
being to say that the tooth in question is being “eaten by a maggot” (<i lang="ms">di-makan ulat</i>).
</p>
<p>The “Batak” Malays (a Mid-Sumatran tribe, many of whom have settled in Kuala Langat)
are said to chip the teeth of their children into the desired shape by the use of
a small chisel, the operation causing such exquisite agony that the sufferer will
not unfrequently leap to his feet with a shriek.
</p>
<p>Even when the file is used, the work of an unskilful performer (who does not know
how to destroy the “venom” of his instruments) will cause the sufferer’s face to be
completely swollen up (<i lang="ms">bakup</i>) for a long period subsequent to the operation. Yet young people of both sexes cheerfully
submit to the risk of this discomfort, and the only remark made by the youth whom
I saw undergoing it was that it “made his mouth feel uncomfortable” (<i lang="ms">jĕlejeh rasa mulut-nya</i>).
</p>
<p>The ear-boring ceremony (<i lang="ms">bĕrtindek</i>) appears to have already lost much of its ceremonial character in Selangor, where
I was told that it is now usually performed when the child is quite small, <i>i.e.</i> at the earliest, when the child is some five or seven months old, and when it is
about a year old at the latest, whereas in Sumatra (according to Marsden) it is not
performed until the child is eight or nine.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17312src" href="#xd32e17312">47</a> Still, however, a special kind <span class="pageNum" id="pb360">[<a href="#pb360">360</a>]</span>of round ear-ring, which is of filagree-work, and is called <i lang="ms">subang</i>, is as much the emblem of virginity in the western States as it ever was. The “discarding”
of these ear-rings (<i lang="ms">tanggal subang</i>), which should take place about seven days after the conclusion of the marriage rites,
is ceremonial in character, and it is even the custom when a widow (<i lang="ms">janda</i>) is married for the second time, to provide her with a pair of <i lang="ms">subang</i> (which should, however, it is said, be <i>tied</i> on to her ears instead of being inserted in the ear-holes, as in the case of a girl
who has never been married).
</p>
<p>The rite of circumcision is of course common to Muhammadans all over the world. Some
analogous practices, however, have also been noticed among the non-Muhammadan Malayan
races of the Eastern Archipelago, and it is at least doubtful whether circumcision
as now practised by Malays is a purely Muhummadan rite. Among Malays it is performed
by a functionary called the “Mudim,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17344src" href="#xd32e17344">48</a> with a slip of bamboo, at any age (in the case of boys) from about six or seven up
to about sixteen years, the wound being often dressed (at least in town districts)
with fine clay mixed with soot and the yolk of eggs, but when possible, the clay is
mixed with cocoa-nut fibre (<i lang="ms">rabok niyor</i>), <i lang="ms">sĕlumur paku uban</i>, and the young shoots of the <i lang="ms">k’lat</i> plantain (<i lang="ms">puchok pisang k’lat</i>), the compound being called in either case <span class="pageNum" id="pb361">[<a href="#pb361">361</a>]</span><i lang="ms">ubat tasak</i>. The ceremony is associated with the common purificatory rite called <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>, and with <i lang="ms">ayer tolak bala</i> (lit. evil-dispelling water). Lights are kept burning in the house for several days
(“until the wound has healed”), and the performance of the ceremony is always made
the occasion for a banquet, together with music and dancing of the kind in which Malays
take so much delight. The cause of these rejoicings is dressed for the occasion “like
a bridegroom” (<i lang="ms">pĕngantin</i>), and is said to be sometimes carried in procession.

</div>
<p class="first">As a general rule, however, this particular class of <span class="pageNum" id="pb362">[<a href="#pb362">362</a>]</span>charms shows particularly strong traces of Arabic influence, most often, perhaps,
taking the form of an injunction (addressed to Jins or Angels) to watch over the person
of the petitioner.
</p>
<p>To rightly understand charms of the second class, which includes Bathing and Betel-charming
charms,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17418src" href="#xd32e17418">49</a> we must have some idea of the Malay standard of beauty. This, I need hardly say,
differs widely from that entertained by Europeans. In the case of manly beauty we
should, perhaps, be able to acquiesce to some extent in the admiration which Malays
express for “Brightness of Countenance” (<i lang="ms">chahia</i>), which forms one of the chief objects of petition in almost every one of this class
of charms;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17429src" href="#xd32e17429">50</a> but none of our modern Ganymedes would be likely to petition for a “voice like the
voice of the Prophet David”;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17436src" href="#xd32e17436">51</a> or a “countenance like the countenance of the Prophet Joseph”; still less would he
be likely to petition for a tongue “curled like a breaking wave,” or “a magic serpent,”
or for teeth “like a herd of (black) elephants,” or for lips “like a procession of
ants.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17439src" href="#xd32e17439">52</a>
</p>
<p>Malay descriptions of female beauty are no less curious. The “brow” (of the Malay
Helen, for whose sake a thousand desperate battles are fought in Malay romances) “is
like the one-day-old moon,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17444src" href="#xd32e17444">53</a> her eyebrows resemble “pictured clouds,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17448src" href="#xd32e17448">54</a> and are “arched like the fighting-cock’s (artificial) spur,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17452src" href="#xd32e17452">55</a> her cheek resembles “the sliced-off-cheek of a mango,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17456src" href="#xd32e17456">56</a> her nose “an opening jasmine bud,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17460src" href="#xd32e17460">57</a> her hair the “wavy blossom-shoots of the areca-palm,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17465src" href="#xd32e17465">58</a> slender<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17469src" href="#xd32e17469">59</a> is her <span class="pageNum" id="pb363">[<a href="#pb363">363</a>]</span>neck, “with a triple row of dimples,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17475src" href="#xd32e17475">60</a> her bosom ripening,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17479src" href="#xd32e17479">61</a> her waist “lissom as the stalk of a flower,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17483src" href="#xd32e17483">62</a> her head “of a perfect oval” (lit. bird’s-egg-shaped), her fingers like the leafy
“spears of lemon-grass,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17488src" href="#xd32e17488">63</a> or the “quills of the porcupine,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17492src" href="#xd32e17492">64</a> her eyes “like the splendour of the planet Venus,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17496src" href="#xd32e17496">65</a> and her lips “like the fissure of a pomegranate.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17500src" href="#xd32e17500">66</a>
</p>
<p>The following is a specimen of an invocation for beautifying the person which is supposed
to be used by children:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“The light of four Suns, five Moons,
</p>
<p class="line">And the seven Stars be visible in my eye.
</p>
<p class="line">The brightness of a shooting star be upon my chin,
</p>
<p class="line">And that of the full moon be upon my brows.
</p>
<p class="line">May my lips be like unto a string of ants,
</p>
<p class="line">My teeth like to a herd of elephants,
</p>
<p class="line">My tongue like a breaking wave,
</p>
<p class="line">My voice like the voice of the Prophet David,
</p>
<p class="line">My countenance like the countenance of the Prophet Joseph,
</p>
<p class="line">My brightness like the brightness of the Prophet Muhammad,
</p>
<p class="line">By virtue of my using this charm that was coeval with my birth,
</p>
<p class="line">And by grace of ‘There is no god but God,’ ” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When personal attractions begin to wane with the lapse of years, invocations are resorted
to for the purpose of restoring the petitioner’s lost youth. In one of the invocations
referred to (which is said to have been used by the Princess of Mount Ophir, Tuan
Pŭtri Gunong Ledang, to secure perpetual youth), the petitioner boasts that he (or
she) was “born under the Inverted Banyan Tree,” and claims the granting of the boon
applied for “by virtue of the use of the “Black Lĕnggundi Bush,” which when it has
<span class="pageNum" id="pb364">[<a href="#pb364">364</a>]</span>died, returns to life again,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17523src" href="#xd32e17523">67</a> the idea being, no doubt, that a judicious use of black magic will enable the petitioner
to “live backwards.”
</p>
<p>The third class of invocations, for rendering the person formidable, belong rather
to the chapter on war, under which heading they will be included.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">5.</span> BETROTHAL</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Betrothal is called <i lang="ms">tunangan</i> or <i lang="ms">pinangan</i>. When the parents of a marriageable youth perceive a suitable “match” for their son,
they send a messenger to her parents to ask if she has yet been “bespoken” (<i lang="ms">kalau ada orang sĕbut</i>). If the reply is satisfactory, the messenger is again despatched to intimate the
desire of the youth’s parents to “bespeak” the hand of the favoured individual for
his son, and to arrange a day for a meeting. These preliminaries are accompanied by
the usual polite self-depreciation on both sides. Thus, the girl’s father begins by
saying, “You wish to bespeak the hand of my daughter, who knows neither how to cook
nor how to sew” (<i lang="ms">yang ta’tahu masak, ta’tahu mĕnjait</i>). But the custom is not carried to such extremes as it is in China.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17550src" href="#xd32e17550">68</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb365">[<a href="#pb365">365</a>]</span></p>
<p>The girl’s parents next call four or five witnesses (<i lang="ms">saksi</i>) of either sex to “witness” the betrothal, and after preparing a meal (<i lang="ms">nasi dan kueh</i>) for their expected guests, await the arrival of the youth’s “Representatives,” the
youth himself remaining at home. One of the party carries a betel-leaf tray furnished
with the usual betel-chewing appliances, together with half a <i lang="ms">bhara</i> of dollars ($11) according to the stricter custom; although (failing the dollars),
a ring or bracelet, or other jewellery of that value, may be substituted.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure plate08width" id="plate08"><img src="images/plate08.jpg" alt="Plate 8.—Betrothal Gifts." width="581" height="421"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Plate 8.—Betrothal Gifts.</span></p>
<p class="first">Bird-shaped receptacles, formerly used for containing rice for presentation purposes
during betrothal, the bird at the bottom representing a peacock (<i lang="ms">mĕrak</i>). Round its neck are hung two smaller receptacles also for rice.
</p>
<p><i>Page 365.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Bearing these presents with them, the youth’s representatives proceed to the house
of the girl’s parents, where they are invited to enter and partake of the betel-leaf
provided for them. A meal is then served, Malay cakes (<i lang="ms">kueh-kueh</i>) brought forward, and the company again partake of betel.
</p>
<p>The two parties now sit down in a “family circle,” and one of the youth’s representatives
pushes forward (<i lang="ms">di-sorongkan</i>) the betel which they had brought with them, and offers it to the people of the house,
saying, “This is a pledge of your daughter’s betrothal.” The girl’s father replies,
“Be it so, I accept it,” or words to that effect, and inquires how long the engagement
is to last, the answer being “six months” or “a year” as the case may be. Both parties
then appeal to the witnesses to “hear what is said,” and the youth’s relatives return
to their homes.
</p>
<p>The marriage portion being fixed (in Selangor) by an almost universal custom at two
<i lang="ms">bharas</i> of dollars ($44), the amount is not usually mentioned at the betrothal, it being
understood that the usual amount is intended. But if the girl’s parents should afterwards
prove reluctant to proceed with the match, they <span class="pageNum" id="pb366">[<a href="#pb366">366</a>]</span>forfeit twice the amount of the pledge-money which they have received; whereas if
the youth refuses to proceed he merely forfeits the pledge-money ($11) already paid
to the girl’s parents. Some families pay a marriage portion of $30 only, and others
(such as the family of ’Toh Kaya Kĕchil of Klang) pay as much as $50, but exceptions
are rare, $44 being now generally recognised as the customary wedding portion.
</p>
<p>However, the girl’s family does not really receive anything like the full value of
the $44, because if the $44 is paid in full the proposer has a right to demand a complete
outfit (<i lang="ms">pĕrsalinan</i>) of silk attire, to the value of about $20, so that the amount which actually changes
hands is seldom more than about $24.

<p class="first">The two square cloths resembling “D’oyleys” represent two different patterns of the
<i lang="ms">gĕdĕbong</i>, a cloth (in three thicknesses and sizes) used for wrapping up the presentation betel-leaf
during the period of betrothal.
</p>
<p><i>Page 366.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>The Malay <i>fiancée</i>, unlike her European sister, is at the utmost pains to keep <i>out</i> of her lover’s way, and to attain this object she is said to be “as watchful as a
tiger.” No engagement-ring is used in this neighbourhood, no priest (or Lĕbai) is
present at the engagement ceremony, nor is the girl asked for her consent. On the
other hand, a regular system of exchanging presents, after the engagement, is said
to have been formerly in vogue in Selangor, the man sending betel-leaf, fruit, and
eggs to his <i>fiancée</i> from time to time in net-work receptacles, and the woman sending specially prepared
rice, etc. in rush-work receptacles of various patterns. It is said, too, that the
woman would occasionally carve a chain, consisting of three or four links, out of
a single areca-nut, in which case the prospective bridegroom was supposed to redeem
it by the payment of as many dollars as there were links. The betel-nut presented
on these occasions <span class="pageNum" id="pb367">[<a href="#pb367">367</a>]</span>would be wrapped up in a gradation of three beautifully worked cloths, not unlike
“D’oyleys” in general appearance, whilst the actual engagement ceremony in former
days is said to have received additional interest and formality from the recital of
verses appropriate to the occasion by chosen representatives of each party. Specimens
of the betrothal verses formerly used in Selangor will be found in the Appendix. The
following is a translation:—

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the term of betrothal is drawing to its close, a suitable day (which is frequently
a Tuesday) is <span class="pageNum" id="pb369">[<a href="#pb369">369</a>]</span>chosen for the work of decoration (<i lang="ms">bĕrgantong-gantong</i>) by the parents of both parties, and notified to the relations and friends who wish
to assist in the preparations for the wedding.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17818src" href="#xd32e17818">75</a>
</p>
<p>Both houses are decorated with vertically striped hangings (<i lang="ms">p’lang tabir</i>) and ornamental ceiling-cloths (<i lang="ms">langit-langit</i>), and mats, rugs, carpets, etc. are laid down. In the bridegroom’s house little is
done beyond erecting a small platform or dais (<i lang="ms">pĕtărana</i>) about six feet square, and raised about ten inches from the floor, upon which he
is to don his wedding garments when he sets out to meet the bride. A similar platform
(<i lang="ms">pĕtărana</i>) is erected in the bride’s house, and a low dais called <i lang="ms">rambat</i> in front of her door, at the outer corners of which are fixed two standard candlesticks
(<i lang="ms">tiang rambat</i>), which are sometimes as much as six feet high, and each of which carries three candles,
one in the centre and one on each side, those at the side being supported by ornamental
brackets (<i lang="ms">sulor bayong</i>). The <i lang="ms">rambat</i> may measure some 14 feet in <span class="pageNum" id="pb370">[<a href="#pb370">370</a>]</span>length by 5 feet in width, and should be about 14 inches in height.
</p>
<p>A dais (with two steps to it) is then built as follows, generally opposite the doorway,
but standing a little way back from it, and facing the <i lang="ms">rambat</i>, so as to leave a narrow passage (<i lang="ms">tela kĕchil</i>) between the threshold and the dais, which latter is decked with scarlet, or at least
scarlet-bordered cloth (<i lang="ms">kain bĕrumpok dĕngan săkalat</i>). The lower step of the dais (<i lang="ms">ibu g’rei</i>) is raised about 12 inches from the floor, and measures from 10 feet to 12 feet in
length by 8 feet in width. The upper step (<i lang="ms">g’rei pĕnapah</i>) is a little smaller, and is only raised about 10 inches above the lower one. The
top of the dais is covered with a mattress, and both steps are decorated with expensive
borders, which at the wedding of a Raja are made of embossed gold or silver, and may
easily cost as much as $150 each, or even more. The mattress is covered in its turn
with a quilt (<i lang="ms">lihap</i> or <i lang="ms">pĕlampap</i>), made of coloured silk stuffed with cotton; upon this quilt is laid a white cotton
sheet, and the whole is surmounted by a row of colossal “pillows” (of the size of
small packing-cases), surmounted by others of moderate size.
</p>
<p>A mosquito-curtain is hung over all, and the completed couch is called <i lang="ms">pĕlamin</i>. The head of the <i lang="ms">pĕlamin</i>, it must be added, where the pillows are piled, is always on the left-hand side as
you look towards it.
</p>
<p>The number of the pillows used is of the highest importance, as indicating the rank
of the contracting parties. The larger ones are about 5 feet in length and 2 feet
in height by 1½ feet in width. They are covered with rich embroidery at the exposed
end, and are arranged in a horizontal row (<i lang="ms">sa-tunda</i>), with their sides just touching, in the front left-hand <span class="pageNum" id="pb371">[<a href="#pb371">371</a>]</span>corner of the mosquito-curtain, so as to leave a clear passage of about 3 feet behind
them (at the back of the curtain) by which the bride and bridegroom may escape to
the <i lang="ms">pĕraduan</i> after the ceremony. These big pillows are white, with the exception of the embroidered
ends, unless they are intended for a Raja, when the royal colour (yellow) is of course
substituted. The one nearest the centre of the couch is called <i lang="ms">bantal tumpu</i>, and usually has a hexagonal or (in the case of a Raja) octagonal bolster deposited
beside it.
</p>
<p>The smaller pillows are red (occasionally purple, <i lang="ms">ungu</i>, or orange, <i lang="ms">jingga</i>), and are called the “embroidered pillows” (<i lang="ms">bantal bĕrtĕkat</i>, or <i lang="ms">bantal p’rada</i>). Occasionally a set of twelve small pillows is used (when they are called <i lang="ms">bantal dua-b’las</i>, or the Twelve Pillows), but often there is only one of them to each “Big Pillow,”
the set of twelve being said to be an innovation, probably introduced from Malacca.
Sometimes, however, when many small pillows are piled upon each other, measures have
to be taken to keep them from falling, in which case the space between the piles is
said to be filled up with wool or cotton stuffing (<i lang="ms">pĕnyĕlat</i>), the front being covered with embroidered cloth, the upper border of which is carried
up diagonally from the top of one pile to the top of the next.
</p>
<p>As regards the permissible number of big pillows, according to a scale in use at Klang,
the common people are allowed three big pillows (including the <i lang="ms">bantal tumpu</i>); a wealthy man, four; and a Headman, such as the ’Toh Kaya Kĕchil, five; a Raja
being presumably allowed one or two more. According to this scale it is only the big
pillows that are of importance,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17967src" href="#xd32e17967">76</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb372">[<a href="#pb372">372</a>]</span>and the people are allowed to use as few or as many small ones as they like. The topmost
small pillow, however, is always triangular, and is called <i lang="ms">gunong-gunongan</i>.

<p class="first">Pattern of fringe used for the mosquito curtain at Malay wedding ceremonies, called
<i lang="ms">daun budi</i>, or the Bo-leaf fringe.
</p>
<p><i>Page 372.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>The mosquito-curtain (enclosing the couch on which the pillows rest) of course varies
in size according to the dimensions of the <i lang="ms">pĕlamin</i>, but may be roughly taken to be from 7 to 9 <i lang="ms">hasta</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17997src" href="#xd32e17997">77</a> in length, by 8 ft. in width, and 4 ft. to 5 ft. in height (reaching to the ceiling-cloth).
Its upper edges (<i lang="ms">kansor</i>) are stiffened externally with a square frame, consisting of four bamboo rods (<i lang="ms">galah k’lambu</i>), and it is decorated in front with a beautifully embroidered fringe called “Bo-tree
leaves” (<i lang="ms">daun budi</i>). The front of this mosquito-curtain is rolled up<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18013src" href="#xd32e18013">78</a> to within 2 or 3 ft. of the top, instead of being drawn aside as usual. At the back
of the curtain is suspended, except in the case of a Raja’s wedding, a bamboo clothes-rod
(<i lang="ms">buluh sangkutkan kain</i>). This rod terminates at each extremity in an ornamental piece of scroll-work (<i lang="ms">sulor bayong</i>) covered with scarlet cloth, which is sometimes made to issue from a short stem of
horn or ivory, and has a wooden collar called <i lang="ms">dulang-dulang</i>. This <i lang="ms">dulang-dulang</i>, moreover, is sometimes provided with small hollows (<i lang="ms">’mbat-’mbat</i>) at the top, two in front which are filled with rose-water or perfume (<i lang="ms">ayer mawar</i> or <i lang="ms">ayer wangi</i>), and two at the back which are filled with flowers.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb373">[<a href="#pb373">373</a>]</span></p>
<p>Above the clothes-rod, and between its suspending cords (<i lang="ms">tali pĕnggantong</i>)—which, by the way, are also covered with scarlet cloth—an inner fringe of “Bo-leaves”
(<i lang="ms">daun budi dalam</i>) is sometimes added at the top of the curtain.
</p>
<p>At the wedding of a Raja nothing else should be put inside the curtain, but at an
ordinary wedding a few small articles of typical marriage furniture are usually added
as follows:—
</p>
<p>Three or four small clothes boxes (<i lang="ms">saharah</i>), such as are kept by every Malay family, and <i lang="ms">pĕti kapor</i> (boxes whose corners are strengthened and decorated with brass) are ranged upon the
mattress just below the clothes-rod. Upon these should be placed (<i>a</i>) the <i lang="ms">bangking</i>, which is a kind of jar or urn of lacquered wood, ranging from about half a foot
to a foot in height, and contains a portion of the bride’s wardrobe; and (<i>b</i>) the <i lang="ms">bun</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18071src" href="#xd32e18071">79</a> which is either octagonal (<i lang="ms">pĕchah d’lapan</i>), or hexagonal (<i lang="ms">pĕchah anam</i>), as the case may be, and which may be described as a box of tin, or sometimes of
lacquered wood, whose contents are as follows:—(1) a couple of combs (<i lang="ms">sikat dua bilah</i>), one with large and one with small teeth; (2) a small cup or saucer of hair oil
(a preparation of cocoa-nut oil), or attar of roses (<i lang="ms">minyak attar</i>), or pomatum (<i lang="ms">kateneh</i>); (3) a small pen-knife for paring the nails; (4) a pair of scissors; (5) a preparation
of antimony (<i lang="ms">chĕlak</i>), which is a sort of black ointment applied by the Malays to the inside edge of the
eyelids; and (6) a Malay work-box (called <i lang="ms">dulang</i> in Selangor and <i lang="ms">bintang</i> at Malacca), which is a circular box of painted or lacquered <span class="pageNum" id="pb374">[<a href="#pb374">374</a>]</span>wood, furnished with a lid, and containing needles, cotton, and the rest of the Malay
housewife’s paraphernalia.
</p>
<p>Near the door of the curtain is placed an earthenware water-jar, called <i lang="ms">gĕlok</i> (<i lang="ms">gĕlok Kĕdah</i> and <i lang="ms">gĕlok Perak</i> are the usual “makes”); this jar stands upon a small brass or earthenware plate with
high sides (<i lang="ms">bokor</i>), and its mouth is covered with a brass or earthenware saucer (<i lang="ms">chepir</i>), on which is laid the brass or earthenware bowl (<i lang="ms">pĕnchedok ayer</i> or <i lang="ms">batil</i>) which is used for scooping up water from the water-jar, and which, when it is in
use, is temporarily replaced by an ornamental cap woven from strips of screw-palm
leaves. A couple of candlesticks placed near the water-jar, a betel tray (<i lang="ms">tepah</i> or <i lang="ms">puan</i>), a basin (<i lang="ms">batil bĕsar</i>) for washing off the lees of henna, and a “cuspadore” (<i lang="ms">kĕtor</i>), all of which are placed inside the curtain, complete the preparations for this
portion of the ceremony.
</p>
<p>The day concludes, as far as the workers are concerned, with a meal in which all who
have assisted in the preparations take part, and this is followed by various diversions
dear to Malays, such as the chanting of passages from the Korān.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18141src" href="#xd32e18141">80</a>
</p>
<p>At a royal wedding, either the “Story of <i lang="ms">’Che Mĕgat</i>” (<i lang="ms">’Che Mĕgat Mantri</i>), or a royal cock-fight (<i lang="ms">main dĕnok</i>), or a performance by dancing girls or fencers (<i lang="ms">pĕdikir</i>), may be substituted for these more devotional exercises.
</p>
<p>These performances (whatever they may be) are kept up (with intervals for rest and
refreshment) till four or five in the morning, when the guests disperse <span class="pageNum" id="pb375">[<a href="#pb375">375</a>]</span>to their respective homes to sleep off the night’s fatigue.
</p>
<p>Whilst the games are progressing (at about nine or ten <span class="sc">P.M.</span>) the first staining of the finger-nails of the bride and bridegroom is commenced,
the ceremony on this occasion being conducted in the seclusion of the inner apartments,
and hence called the “Stolen Henna-staining” (<i lang="ms">bĕrhinei churi</i>). Leaves of henna are taken and pounded together with a small piece of charcoal,
and the “mash” is applied to the finger-nails of both hands (with the exception of
the middle or “Devil’s finger,” <i lang="ms">jari hantu</i>). The centre of each palm is also touched with the dye, the area stained being as
much as would be covered by a dollar. A line (of a finger’s breadth) is also said
to be drawn along the inner side of the sole of each foot, from the great toe to the
heel (<i lang="ms">hinei kaus</i>).

</p>
<p>A couple of what we should call “pages,” of about ten years of age, are seated right
and left of the bridegroom, and are called <i lang="ms">Pĕngapit</i>.
</p>
<p>The bride usually provides herself with one or more girl companions; but these are
supposed to “hide themselves” when there is company, their place being taken by more
staid duennas, who are called <i lang="ms">Tukang Andam</i> (<i>i.e.</i> “coiffeurs”), and a personal attendant or nurse, called <i lang="ms">Ma’inang</i> (<i lang="ms">Mak Inang</i><span class="corr" id="xd32e18221" title="Source: ,)">),</span> who appears to act as a sort of Mistress of the Ceremonies.
</p>
<p>The second day is spent by the guests (as was said above) in sleeping off their night’s
fatigue, and they do not reassemble till evening, at about five <span class="sc">P.M.</span>
</p>
<p>When the last has arrived (at about seven <span class="sc">P.M.</span>) a meal is served, and at about half-past eight the games recommence; but after a
round or so (<i lang="ms">zikir sa-jurus</i>), <span class="pageNum" id="pb376">[<a href="#pb376">376</a>]</span>say at about ten <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, the bride at her house and bridegroom at his respectively make their first appearance
in public, clad in their wedding garments, for the ceremony of staining the finger-nails,
this time in public. When they are seated (between the two candlesticks, which are
lighted to facilitate the operation) a tray is brought forward, furnished with the
usual accessories of Malay magic, rice-paste (<i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>), washed rice, “saffron” rice, and parched rice, to which is added, in this instance,
a sort of pudding of the pounded henna-leaves. A censer is next produced, and a brass
tray with a foot to it (called <i lang="ms">sĕmb’rip</i>) is loaded with <i lang="ms">nasi bĕrhinei</i> (<i lang="ms">pulut</i> or “glutinous” rice stained with saffron), in which are planted some ten to fifteen
purple eggs (dyed with a mixture of brazil wood (<i lang="ms">sĕpang</i>) and lime, and stuck upon ornamental sprays of bamboo decorated with coloured paper).
The bride (or bridegroom) is then seated in a “begging” attitude, with the hands resting
upon a cushion placed in the lap; the first of the guests then takes a pinch of incense
from the tray and burns it in the brazier (<i lang="ms">tĕmpat bara</i>); next he takes a pinch of parched rice, a pinch of newly-washed rice, and a pinch
of saffron rice, and, squeezing them together in the right fist, fumigates them by
holding them for a moment over the burning incense, and then throws them towards the
sitter, first towards the right, then towards the left, and finally into the sitter’s
lap.
</p>
<p>The “Neutralising Paste”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18264src" href="#xd32e18264">81</a> is then brought and the usual leaf-brush dipped into the bowl of paste, with which
the forehead of the sitter and the back of each hand are duly “painted.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb377">[<a href="#pb377">377</a>]</span></p>
<p>A pinch of the henna is then taken and dabbed upon the centre of each palm, the hands
of the sitter being turned over to enable this to be done.
</p>
<p>The sitter then salutes the guest by raising his (or her) hands with the palms together
before the breast in an attitude of prayer; the guest replies by a similar action,
and the ceremony is at an end.
</p>
<p>The same operation is performed by from five to seven, or even nine, relations (<i lang="ms">Orang Waris</i>, lit. “Heirs,”) the last operator concluding with an Arabic prayer.
</p>
<p>While this ceremony is proceeding inside, music strikes up and a special dance, called
the Henna Dance (<i lang="ms">mĕnari hinei</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18289src" href="#xd32e18289">82</a> is performed, a picturesque feature of which is a small cake of henna, which is contained
in a brazen cup (<i lang="ms">gompong hinei</i>) and surrounded by candles. This cup is carried by the dancer,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18295src" href="#xd32e18295">83</a> who has to keep turning it over and over without letting the candles be extinguished
by the wind arising from the rapid motion.
</p>
<p>The step, which is a special one, is called the “Henna-dance Step” (<i lang="ms">Langkah tar’ hinei</i>, i.e. <i lang="ms">tari hinei</i>), and the tune is called the “Henna-staining tune” (<i lang="ms">Lagu bĕrhinei</i>).
</p>
<p>This ceremony over, the “henna-staining” rice (<i lang="ms">nasi bĕrhinei</i>) is partaken of by those present, the remainder being distributed to the guests engaged
in “<i lang="ms">main zikir</i>.”
</p>
<p>On the third night the same ceremonies are repeated without variation.
</p>
<p>On the fourth morning, called the “Concluding <span class="pageNum" id="pb378">[<a href="#pb378">378</a>]</span>Day” (<i lang="ms">Hari Langsong</i>), everybody puts on his finest apparel and jewellery.

</p>
<p>The bride’s hair is done up in a roll (<i lang="ms">sanggul</i>) and this is surmounted with a head-dress of artificial flowers (called <i lang="ms">g’rak gĕmpa</i>), cut out of <i lang="ms">p’rada kresek</i> (“crackling tinsel”) and raised on fine wires; her forehead is bound with a band
or fillet of tinsel—gold-leaf (<i lang="ms">p’rada Siam</i>) being used by the rich—which is called <i lang="ms">tĕkan kundei</i>, and is carried round by the fringe of the hair (<i lang="ms">gigi rambut</i>) down to the top of each ear (<i lang="ms">pĕlipis</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18375src" href="#xd32e18375">84</a>; for the rest the bride is clad in a “wedding jacket” (<i lang="ms">baju pĕngantin</i>), which has tight-fitting sleeves extending down to the wrist, or sleeves with gathers
(<i lang="ms">simak</i>) over the arm, and which is generally made of “flowered satin” (<i lang="ms">siten bĕrbunga</i>) in the case of the rich, or of cloth dyed red with <i lang="ms">kasumba</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18396src" href="#xd32e18396">85</a> (<i lang="ms">kain kasumba</i>) in the case of the poorer classes. This “wedding jacket” fits tightly round the
neck, has a gold border (<i lang="ms">pĕndĕpun ’mas</i>), is fastened with two or three gold buttons, and fits closely to the person; the
wealthy add a necklace or crescent-shaped breast-ornament (<i lang="ms">rantei mĕrjan</i> or <i lang="ms">dokoh</i>) round the bride’s neck. She also wears bracelets (<i lang="ms">g’lang</i>) and ear-rings (<i lang="ms">subang</i>) and perhaps anklets, of five different metals (<i lang="ms">kĕronchong panchalogam</i>). A silk <i lang="ms">sarong</i>, which takes the place of a skirt, and is girt about the waist with a waist-cord
(but <i>not</i> usually, in Southern Selangor, fastened with belt and buckle), and a pair of silk
trousers, complete her attire.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb379">[<a href="#pb379">379</a>]</span></p>
<p>The groom, on the other hand, is clad in his best jacket and trousers, with the Malay
skirt (<i lang="ms">sarong</i>), fastened at the side, and girt above the knee (<i lang="ms">kain kĕmbang</i>). His head is adorned with the <i lang="ms">sigar</i>, a peculiar head-dress of red cloth arranged turbanwise, with a peak on the right-hand
side, from which artificial flowers (<i lang="ms">gunjei</i>) depend, and which preserves its shape through being stuffed with cotton-wool. Its
border is decorated with tinsel, and it has a gold fringe (<i lang="ms">kida-kida</i>). Besides this head-dress the bridegroom has a small bunch of artificial flowers
(<i lang="ms">sunting-sunting</i>) stuck behind each ear, whilst two similar bunches are stuck in the head-dress (one
on the right and the other on the left).
</p>
<p>Bridegrooms, however, who belong to the richer classes wear what is called a <i lang="ms">lester</i> (=<i lang="ms">destar?</i>), whilst former Sultans of Selangor are said to have worn a gold cap (<i lang="ms">songkok leleng</i>), which is reputed to have contained eighteen <i lang="ms">bongkal</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18464src" href="#xd32e18464">86</a> (or <i lang="ms">bungkal</i>) of gold.
</p>
<p>The remainder of the company are of course merely dressed in their best clothes.
</p>
<p>The “Rice of the Presence” (<i lang="ms">nasi adap-adap</i>) is now prepared for what is called the <i lang="ms">astakona</i> or <i lang="ms">sĕtakona</i>, which may be described as a framework with an octagonal ground-plan, built in three
tiers, and made of <i lang="ms">pulai</i> or <i lang="ms">mĕranti</i> or other light wood; it has a small mast (<i lang="ms">tiang</i>) planted in the centre, with cross pieces (<i lang="ms">palang-palang</i>) in each of the upper stories to keep it in its place; the framework is supported
by four corner-posts, on which it is raised about a foot and a half from the floor.
The box thus formed is filled to <span class="pageNum" id="pb380">[<a href="#pb380">380</a>]</span>the top with “saffron rice” (<i lang="ms">nasi kunyit</i>), and in the rice at the top are planted the aforesaid coloured eggs. Into a hole
at the top of the mast is fitted the end of a short rattan or cane, which is split
into four branches, each of which again is split into three twigs, whilst on the end
of each twig is stuck one of the coloured eggs (<i lang="ms">tĕlor joran</i>), an artificial flower, and an ornamental streamer of red paper called <i lang="ms">layer</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18513src" href="#xd32e18513">87</a> which is cut into all sorts of artistic and picturesque patterns.
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">sĕtakona</i> is erected in front of the <i lang="ms">pĕlamin</i>, on which the bride takes her seat at about 4 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> to await the coming of the bridegroom, the members of her own bridal party, including
the Muhammadan priest or <i lang="ms">Imām</i>, continuing the <i lang="ms">zikir maulud</i> in the reception room at frequent intervals from 9 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> until the bridegroom’s arrival. The arrangements are completed by placing ready for
the bridegroom the “Bridal Mat” (<i lang="ms">lapik nikah</i>), which consists of a mat of screw-palm leaves (or in the case of a Raja, a small
quilt, embroidered in the manner called <i lang="ms">jong sarat</i>) five cubits of white cloth, which are rolled up and put on one side, and a tray
of betel.
</p>
<p>Returning to the bridegroom, holy water (<i lang="ms">ayer sĕmbahyang</i>) is now fetched in a <i lang="ms">chĕrek</i> (a kettle-shaped vessel) or bucket, for the bridegroom to wash his face and hands,
and he then proceeds to put on his wedding garments, as described above, after which
a scarf (<i lang="ms">salendang</i>) is slung across his shoulder. The marriage procession (<i lang="ms">pĕrarakan</i>) then sets out, the women heading it (<i lang="ms">pĕnganjor</i>) and the men following, the bridegroom carried upon somebody’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb381">[<a href="#pb381">381</a>]</span>shoulders (<i lang="ms">di-sompoh</i>), and right and left the musicians beating drums, tabors, etc., whilst those who
have any skill amuse the company with exhibitions of Malay fencing (<i lang="ms">main silat</i>) and dancing, etc., to the accompaniment of the <i lang="ms">zikir</i> intoned by their companions.
</p>
<p>The arrival of the bridegroom at the bride’s house is the signal for a mimic conflict
for the person of the bride, which is called <i lang="ms">mĕlawa</i>, and is strangely reminiscent of similar customs which formerly obtained in Europe.
</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>In some cases a rope or piece of red cloth would be stretched across the path to bar
the progress of the bridegroom’s party, and a stout enough resistance would be offered
by the defenders until the bridegroom consented to pay a fine which formerly amounted,
it is said, to as much as $20, though not more than $3 or $4 would now be asked. Occasionally
the bridegroom would pay the fine by pulling the ring off his finger and handing it
to the bride’s relations, but the ceremony would not unfrequently end in a free fight.
Verses were recited on these occasions, of which a few stanzas will be found in the
Appendix.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18589src" href="#xd32e18589">88</a>
</p>
<p>On arriving at the door the musicians strike up their liveliest tune, and as the bridegroom
is carried up the steps he has to force his way through an Amazonian force consisting
of the ladies of the bride’s party, who assemble to repel the invader from the threshold.
A well-directed fire is maintained by others, who pour upon the foe over the heads
of the defenders <span class="pageNum" id="pb382">[<a href="#pb382">382</a>]</span>repeated volleys of saffron rice (or, at a royal wedding, <i lang="ms">ambor-ambor</i>—<i>i.e.</i> clippings from a thin sheet of silver or gold which are thrown among the crowd as
largess).

<p class="first">Presentation “betel-leaf trees” (<i lang="ms">poko’ sirih</i>), said to have been formerly carried in procession at weddings. These so-called “trees”

“tree” are hornbills.
</p>
<p><i>Page 382.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the bridegroom persists until his efforts are crowned with success, and
he makes his way (assisted possibly by some well-meant act of treachery on the part
of the garrison) to the reception room, when the mat already referred to is unrolled
and the white cloth suspended over it. Here the bridegroom takes his seat and the
priest comes out to perform the wedding ceremony.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18639src" href="#xd32e18639">89</a> This, strangely enough, is performed with the bridegroom alone, the priest saying
to him in the presence of three or four witnesses and his surety (<i lang="ms">wali</i>), generally his father, “I wed you, A., to B., daughter of C., for a portion of two
<i lang="ms">bharas</i>.” To this the bridegroom has to respond without allowing an interval, “I accept this
marriage with B., for a portion of two <i lang="ms">bharas</i>” (or one <i lang="ms">bhara</i> if one of the parties has been married before). Even this short sentence, however,
is a great deal too much for the nerves of some Malay bridegrooms, who have been known
to spend a couple of hours in abortive attempts before they could get the Imām to
“pass” it. As soon, however, as this obstacle has been surmounted, the priest asks
those present if they will bear witness to its correctness, and on their replying
in the affirmative, it is followed by the “<i lang="ms">bacha salawat</i>,” which consists of repeated shouts from the company <span class="pageNum" id="pb383">[<a href="#pb383">383</a>]</span>of “Peace be with thee.” This part of the ceremony completed, one of the brothers
or near relations of the bridegroom leads him into the bridal chamber, and seats him
in the usual cross-legged position on the left side of the bride, who sits with her
feet tucked up on his right. Even the process of seating the couple (<i lang="ms">bĕrsanding</i>) is a very fatiguing one; each of them has to bend the knees slowly until a sitting
posture is reached, and then return to a standing posture by slowly straightening
the knees, a gymnastic exercise which has to be repeated thrice, and which requires
the assistance of friends.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18678src" href="#xd32e18678">90</a>
</p>
<p>The seating having been accomplished, friends put in the right hands of bride and
bridegroom respectively handfuls of rice taken from the <i lang="ms">nasi sĕtakona;</i> with this the two feed each other simultaneously, each of them reaching out the hand
containing the rice to the other’s mouth. (This part of the ceremony is often made
the occasion for a race.)
</p>
<p>The bridegroom is then carried off by his friends to the outer chamber, where he has
to pay his respects (<i lang="ms">minta’ maʿaf</i>, lit. “ask pardon”) to the company, after which he is carried back to his old post,
the bride in the meantime having moved off a little in the mosquito curtain.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb384">[<a href="#pb384">384</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sweetmeats are then brought and handed round, the <i lang="ms">sĕtakona</i> is broken up, and the bundles of rice wrapped in plantain leaves which it contains
distributed to the company as largess or <i lang="ms">bĕrkat</i>. Each of the company gets one of the <i lang="ms">tĕlor chachak</i>, the <i lang="ms">tĕlor joran</i> being reserved for the Imām and any person of high rank who may attend, <i>e.g.</i> a Raja.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18727src" href="#xd32e18727">91</a>
</p>
<p>This completes the wedding ceremony, but the bridegroom is nominally expected to remain
under the roof (and eye) of his mother-in-law for about two years (reduced to forty-four
days in the case of “royalty”), after which he may be allowed to remove to a house
of his own. No Kathi<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18732src" href="#xd32e18732">92</a> was present until quite recently at marriages in Selangor, nor has it in the past
been the practice, so far as I could find out, for him to attend. Sir S. Raffles gives
as part of the formula used in Java:—“If you travel at sea for a year, or ashore for
six months, without sending either money or message to your wife, she will complain
to the judge and obtain one <i lang="ms">talak</i> (the preliminary stage of divorce),” and this condition should, strictly speaking,
be included in the Malay formula. It is now growing obsolete, but was in former days
repeated first by the priest, and then by the bridegroom after him. The marriage portion
(<i lang="ms">isi kahwin</i>, Arabic <i lang="ms">mahar</i>) is here generally called <i lang="ms">b’lanja kahwin</i> or <i lang="ms">mas kahwin</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18751src" href="#xd32e18751">93</a> No wedding-ring should, strictly, be given.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb385">[<a href="#pb385">385</a>]</span></p>
<p>For three days lustrations are continued by the newly-married pair, but before they
are completed, and as soon as possible after the wedding, friends and acquaintances
once more put on their finery, and proceed to the house to pay their respects, to
bathe, and to receive largess.
</p>
<p>On the third day after the <i lang="ms">hari langsong</i> there is a very curious ceremony called <i lang="ms">mandi tolak bala</i>, or <i lang="ms">mandi ayer salamat</i> (bathing for good luck).
</p>
<p>On the night in question the relatives of the bridegroom assemble under cover of the
darkness and make a bonfire under the house of the newly-married couple by collecting
and burning rubbish; into the fire thus kindled they throw cocoa-nut husks and pepper,
or anything likely to make it unpleasant for those within, and presently raise such
a smoke that the bridegroom comes hastily down the steps, ostensibly to see what is
the matter, but as soon as he makes his appearance, he is seized by his relatives
and carried off bodily to his own parents’ house; these proceedings being known as
the stealing of the bridegroom (<i lang="ms">churi pĕngantin</i>). Next day there is a grand procession to escort him back to the house of his bride,
which he reaches about one o’clock in the afternoon, the processionists carrying “Rice
of the Presence” (<i lang="ms">nasi adap-adap</i>) with the eggs stuck into it as on the last day of the wedding, two sorts of holy
water in pitchers, called respectively <i lang="ms">ayer salamat</i> (water of good luck), and <i lang="ms">ayer tolak bala</i> (water to avert ill-luck), vases of flowers (<i lang="ms">gumba</i>) containing blossom-spikes of the cocoa-nut and areca-nut palms, and young cocoa-nut
leaves rudely plaited into the semblance of spikes of palm-blossom, k’risses, etc.
etc., together with a large number of rude syringes manufactured from joints of bamboo,
and called <i lang="ms">panah ayer</i>, or “water-bows.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb386">[<a href="#pb386">386</a>]</span></p>
<p>A set of similar objects (including <i lang="ms">nasi adap-adap</i>), is prepared by the relatives of the bride, and deposited upon the ground in the
place selected for the bathing ceremony. A bench being added for the bride and bridegroom
to sit upon, the ceremony commences with the customary rite of <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i>, after which the two kinds of holy water, <i lang="ms">ayer tolak bala</i> and <i lang="ms">ayer salamat</i>, are successively thrown over the pair.
</p>
<p>Now, according to the proper custom, during the proceedings which follow, all the
bride’s relatives should surround the bride’s seat, and the bridegroom’s relatives
should stand at a distance; but, in order to save themselves from a wetting, the women
of both parties now usually assemble round the bride and bridegroom, where they are
protected by a sheet which is hung between them and the men; for all the young men
now proceed to discharge their “water arrows,” and as they are stopped by the sheet
they proceed to turn their syringes against each other, until all are thoroughly wetted.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile a young cocoa-nut frond, twisted into a slip-knot with V-shaped ends (something
like the “merry thought” of a fowl), is presented to the bride and bridegroom, each
of whom takes hold of one end, and blowing on it (<i lang="ms">sĕmbor</i>) thrice, pulls it till it comes undone, and the <i lang="ms">lĕpas-lĕpas</i> rite is concluded. Finally, a girdle of thread is passed seven times over the heads
and under the feet of the bride and bridegroom, when the bridegroom breaks through
the thread and they are all free to return homewards. This latter ceremony is called
<i lang="ms">’lat-’lat</i>. The guests then return to their homes, divest themselves of their wet garments,
and put on their wedding attire. The <i lang="ms">bĕrsuap-suapan</i>, or feeding ceremony, is then performed (both vessels <span class="pageNum" id="pb387">[<a href="#pb387">387</a>]</span>of <i lang="ms">adap-adap</i> rice being used), and then all parties disperse for the usual games. Seven days after
the “Concluding Day” (<i lang="ms">Hari Langsong</i>), the ceremony of Discarding the Earrings (<i>i.e.</i> <i lang="ms">subang</i>, the emblems of virginity) is performed by the bride.
</p>
<p>Raja Bôt of Selangor, who attaches great importance to the lustration ceremony, and
says that it ought not to take place later than the seventh day (at a Raja’s wedding),
thus describes the full ceremony as once arranged by himself:—A small bath-house was
built at the top of a flight of seven steps, and water was pumped up to it through
a pipe, whose upper end was made fast under the roof of the shed, and terminated in
the head of a dragon (<i lang="ms">naga</i>), from whose jaws the water spouted. The steps were completely lined with women,
of whom there must have been an immense number (no men being allowed to be present),
and the Raja and his bride bathed before them. A royal bath-house of this kind is
called <i lang="ms">balei pancha pĕrsada</i>, and should be used not only at “royal” weddings, but at coronations (<i lang="ms">waktu di-naubatkan</i>); it is described in the following lines:—
</p>
<div lang="ms" class="lgouter xd32e2490">
<p class="line">“Naik balei pancha pĕrsada
</p>
<p class="line">Di-hadap uleh sagala Biduanda,
</p>
<p class="line">Dudok sĕmaiam dĕngan bĕrtakhta.
</p>
<p class="line">Mandi ayer yang kaluar di mulut Naga”—</p>
</div>
<p class="first">which may be translated:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ascend to the Royal Bath-House
</p>
<p class="line">In the presence of all your courtiers,
</p>
<p class="line">Take your seat in royal state,
</p>
<p class="line">And bathe in the water that flows from the Dragon’s Mouth.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It must not be supposed that, with such a mass of detail, many things may not have
been overlooked, <span class="pageNum" id="pb388">[<a href="#pb388">388</a>]</span>but it may be remarked as some sort of a practical conclusion to this account, that
the Malay wedding ceremony, even as carried out by the poorer classes, shows that
the contracting parties are treated as royalty, that is to say, as sacred human beings,
and if any further proof is required, in addition to the evidence which may be drawn
from the general character of the ceremony, I may mention, firstly, the fact that
the bride and bridegroom are actually called <i lang="ms">Raja Sari</i>, (i.e. <i lang="ms">Raja sa-hari</i>, the “sovereigns of a day”); and, secondly, that it is a polite fiction that no command
of theirs, during their one day of sovereignty, may be disobeyed.

<p>I will now give accounts of two Malay weddings which took place at Klang: both accounts
were composed by respectable Malays, the first one being translated by Mr. Douglas
Campbell of Selangor, and the second by the present writer:—
</p>
<p>“The following account of the ceremonies connected with the marriage of Siti Meriam,
a daughter of the Orang Kaya Badu,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18892src" href="#xd32e18892">94</a> of Selangor, to Wan Mahamed Esa, a son of Datoh Mentri<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18898src" href="#xd32e18898">95</a> Ibrahim of Perak, has been furnished by a Malay contributor, Haji Karrim, and in
translating it into English an endeavour has been made to follow, as far as possible,
the style of the native writer.
</p>
<p>“On Monday, the 1st of August, the house was prepared and the hangings and curtains
put up, and on that evening the ceremony of dyeing the fingers of the bridegroom with
henna was performed for the first time. Then there were readings from the Korān, with
much beating of drums and kettledrums and <span class="pageNum" id="pb389">[<a href="#pb389">389</a>]</span>Malay dances, and when this had gone on for some time, supper was served to all the
men present in the <i lang="ms">balei</i>, or separate hall, and to the women in the house adjoining. Supper over, readings
from the Korān and beating of drums were continued till daylight.
</p>
<p>“On Tuesday evening the dyeing of the fingers of the bridegroom was performed for
the second time, as on the preceding evening.
</p>
<p>“The third occasion of dyeing the fingers of the bridegroom took place on Wednesday
evening, but with much more ceremony than previously. The bridegroom, after being
dressed in silks and cloth of gold, was paraded in an open carriage. On each side
of him was seated a groom’sman shading him with a fan, and behind, holding an umbrella
over him, was another. And thus, with many followers beating drums and singing, and
with the Royal <i lang="ms">sireh</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18914src" href="#xd32e18914">96</a>-box, on which are seated the dragons known as <i lang="ms">naga pura</i> and <i lang="ms">naga taru</i>, and with two Royal spears carried before him and two behind, the bridegroom was
taken through the streets in procession. On arriving at the bride’s house he was received
with showers of rose-water, and then conveyed by the elders to the raised dais on
which the bride and bridegroom awaited their friends.
</p>
<p>“The bridegroom being seated, fourteen of the elders came forward and dyed his fingers
with henna, and afterwards others, who were clever at this, followed their example.
While this was going on there was much beating of gongs and drums, and then the same
process of dyeing was repeated on the bride by women<span class="corr" id="xd32e18930" title="Not in source">.</span> Next the Imām came, and, after stating that the dowry was $100 cash, heard Wan Mahamed
Esa <span class="pageNum" id="pb390">[<a href="#pb390">390</a>]</span>publicly receive Siti Meriam as his wife, whereupon the Bilal<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18934src" href="#xd32e18934">97</a> read a prayer and afterwards pronounced a blessing.
</p>
<p>“Supper was then served to all the guests present as before, the men having their
meal in the <i lang="ms">balei</i> and the women in the house adjoining, and singing and dancing was kept up until daylight.
</p>
<p>“On Thursday afternoon the bride, dressed in her best, with her father and relations,
received the Resident, who was accompanied by Mrs. Birch, the Senior District Officer
and Mrs. Turney, Captain and Mrs. Syers, Mr. Edwards, and many other ladies and gentlemen.
Cakes and preserves were served, of which the ladies and gentlemen present partook.
Then the bridegroom arrived, seated in an open carriage with a groom’sman on each
side of him, while one, carrying the Royal silk umbrella, kindly lent by H.H. the
Sultan, went before him.
</p>
<p>“The procession was headed by one of the Royal spears, and two more were carried before
the bridegroom and two behind him, and so, accompanied by the Selangor Band, kindly
lent by the Resident, and by a crowd of people singing and beating gongs and drums,
he was conveyed to the bride’s house. His arrival was greeted with showers of rice,
and he was seated, together with the bride, on the dais, where they, with the assistance
of Mr. and Mrs. Birch, helped each other to partake of yellow rice.
</p>
<p>“So the marriage was completed satisfactorily, and then, as it was evening, the Resident
and Mrs. Birch, and the other ladies and gentlemen present, returned to <span class="pageNum" id="pb391">[<a href="#pb391">391</a>]</span>Kuala Lumpur; the people who remained amusing themselves with dagger dances (<i lang="ms">main dabus</i>).
</p>
<p>“On Friday evening the bride and bridegroom left for Jugra in the <i>Esmeralda</i>, which had been lent by the Resident, to pay their respects to H.H. the Sultan, returning
to Klang on Saturday.
</p>
<p>“On the same afternoon the ceremony of the bath was performed, to the great satisfaction
of every one present, and was kept up till six o’clock, by which time every one was
wet through.
</p>
<p>“This was the last ceremony in connection with the marriage, and then every one wished
the bride and bridegroom much happiness.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18958src" href="#xd32e18958">98</a>
</p>
<p>The following account was translated by the writer:—
</p>
<p>“Preparations for the wedding of Inche Halimah, daughter of Sheikh ʿAbdul Mohit Baktal,
and Said ʿAbdul Rahman Al Jafri, commenced on Monday, the 2nd of August 1895.
</p>
<p>“The mosquito-curtain, tapestries and canopies were suspended, and decorations, including
the marriage furniture (<i lang="ms">pĕti bĕtuah dan bangking</i>), arranged. Moreover, the bridal couch was adorned with decorations of gold and mattresses
raised one above the other, one with a facing of gold and the other with a facing
of silver, and four pillows with gold facings, and five piled-up pillows with silver
facings; and the kitchen apparatus was got ready, including ten pans and coppers of
the largest size, and the sheds for those who were to cook rice and the meats eaten
therewith. On this day, moreover, a buffalo was sent by Towkay Teck Chong, with the
full accompaniments of music, and so forth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb392">[<a href="#pb392">392</a>]</span></p>
<p>“On Tuesday, the 3rd day of the month, took place the first Henna-staining, the bride
being led forth by her Coiffeur and seated upon the marriage throne. And the bride
seated herself against the large pillow, which is called ‘The Pillow against which
One Rests,’ or <i lang="ms">bantal saraga</i>. And towards evening all the relatives on the woman’s side sprinkled the <i lang="ms">tĕpong tawar</i> (upon the forehead and hands of the bride), and after the Henna-staining, dishes
of confectionery and preserved fruits were offered to all the guests who were present
in the reception-room.
</p>
<p>“And on the 3rd<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18981src" href="#xd32e18981">99</a> day of the month there took place in like manner the second Henna-staining. And on
the 5th day of the month took place the Private Henna-staining (<i lang="ms">bĕrhinei churi</i>); the bride’s hair being dressed after the fashion known as <i lang="ms">Sanggul Lintang</i>, and further adorned with ornaments of gold and diamonds to the value of about $5000.
And after this Henna-staining all persons present descended to the rooms below, where
fencing and dagger dances, and music and dancing were kept up at pleasure.
</p>
<p>“On the 6th day of the month, being Friday, Inche Mohamad Kassim, Pĕnghulu of the
Mukim of Bukit Raja, was commissioned by Datoh Pĕnghulu Mohit to summon the bridegroom,
inasmuch as that day was fixed for the marriage rite. And the bridegroom, wearing
the robe called <i lang="ms">jubah</i> and a turban tied after the Arab fashion,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18995src" href="#xd32e18995">100</a> arrived at about three o’clock, and was met by the priest (Tuan Imām) at the house.
Very many were the guests on that day, and many ladies <span class="pageNum" id="pb393">[<a href="#pb393">393</a>]</span>and gentlemen, and his renowned Highness the Tungku Dia-Uddin, were assembled in the
house.
</p>
<p>“And the Tuan Imām read the marriage service, Datoh Pĕnghulu Mohit giving his permission
for Tuan Haji Mohamad Said Mufti to wed Inche Halimah to Said ʿAbdul Rahman Al Jafri,
with a marriage portion of $100. And after the marriage rite Tuan Imām proceeded to
read prayers for their welfare. And afterwards dishes of rice were brought, of which
the guests present were invited to partake. And when all had eaten, the Coiffeur led
forth the bride to the scaffolding for the ceremony called ‘Bathing in State.’ And
upon that same evening took place the Great Henna-staining, and the guests assembled
in exceeding great numbers, both men and women, and filled the house above and below
to overflowing. And when the henna-staining was completed, all the men who were present
chanted (<i lang="ms">bacha maulud</i>) until daybreak.
</p>
<p>“And upon the 7th day of the month, being Saturday, the bride being adorned, the bridegroom
seated in a buggy was drawn in procession at about 5 o’clock from the house of his
renowned Highness Tungku Dia-Uddin, accompanied by the Government Band and all kinds
of music, to the house of the Datoh Pĕnghulu, where he was met and sprinkled with
saffron-rice and rose-water. Afterwards, being seated on the marriage throne side
by side, both husband and wife, they offered each other in turn the mouthfuls of saffron-rice
which were presented by the ladies and gentlemen and His Highness Tungku Dia-Uddin.
</p>
<p>“And afterwards the elder relatives on the side of both husband and bride presented
the rice, and Inche Mohamad Kassim presented red eggs (<i lang="ms">tĕlor bĕrjoran</i>) <span class="pageNum" id="pb394">[<a href="#pb394">394</a>]</span>to all the ladies and gentlemen, and the bridegroom led the bride with him into the
bridal chamber by the finger, walking upon cloth of purple and gold. And afterwards
all the ladies and gentlemen were invited to eat and drink, and the band played, fireworks
and artificial fires were burned, and great was the brightness thereof, and all the
young people danced and sang at their pleasure until the evening was spent.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19013src" href="#xd32e19013">101</a>
</p>
<p>The marriage customs hitherto described have been only such as are based on a peaceful
understanding between the parents of the contracting parties. An account of Malay
marriage customs would not, however, be complete without some mention of the customs
which regulate, strange as it may seem, even the forcible abduction of a wife. Of
these customs Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell says:—
</p>
<p>“The word <i lang="ms">panjat</i> in Malay means literally ‘to climb,’ but it is used in Pêrak, and perhaps in other
Malay States, to signify a forcible entry into a house for the purpose of securing
as a wife a woman whom her relations have already refused to the intruder. This high-handed
proceeding is recognised by Malay custom, and is regulated by certain well-known rules.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Panjat</i> is of two kinds—<i lang="ms">panjat angkara</i> and <i lang="ms">panjat ’adat</i>—entry by violence and entry by custom. In the first case, the man makes his way into
the house armed with his <i lang="ms">kris</i>, or other weapon, and entering the women’s apartment, or posting himself at the door,
secures the person of his intended bride, or prevents her escape. He runs the risk
of being killed on the spot by the girl’s relations, and his safety depends <span class="pageNum" id="pb395">[<a href="#pb395">395</a>]</span>upon his reputation for courage and strength, and upon the number of his friends and
the influence of his family. A wooer who adopts this violent method of compelling
the assent of unwilling relations to his marriage to one of their kin must, say the
Malays, have three qualifications—
</p>
<div lang="ms" class="lgouter xd32e2490">
<p class="line">“Ka-rapat-an baniak,
</p>
<p class="line">Wang-nia ber-lebih,
</p>
<p class="line">Jantan-nia ber-lebih,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">‘A strong party to back him, plenty of money, and no lack of bravery.’
</p>
<p>“Plenty of money is necessary, because, by accepted custom, if the relations yield
and give their consent all the customary payments are doubled; the fine for the trespass,
which would ordinarily be twenty-five dollars, becomes fifty dollars; the dower is
likewise doubled, and the usual present of clothes (<i lang="ms">salin</i>) must consist of two of each of the three garments (<i lang="ms">salendang</i>, <i lang="ms">baju</i>, <i lang="ms">kain</i>), instead of one as usual. The fine for <i lang="ms">panjat angkara</i> may be of any amount, according to the pleasure of the woman’s relations, and they
fix it high or low according to the man’s position. I have heard of one case in Pêrak,
where the fine was five hundred dollars, and another in which the suitor, to obtain
his bride, had to pay one thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars, namely, one thousand
two hundred and fifty dollars as a fine, and five hundred dollars for the marriage
expenses. But in this case the girl was already betrothed to another, and one thousand
dollars out of the fine went to the disappointed rival.
</p>
<p>“Sometimes the relations hold out, or the man, for want of one of the three qualifications
mentioned above, has to beat an ignominious retreat. In the reign of Sultan Ali, one
Mat Taib, a <i lang="ms">budak raja</i>, or personal <span class="pageNum" id="pb396">[<a href="#pb396">396</a>]</span>attendant on the Sultan, asked for Wan Dêna, the daughter of the Bandahara of Kedah
(she then being at Kota Lama in Pêrak) in marriage. Being refused he forced his way
into the house, and seizing the girl by her long hair drew his <i lang="ms">kris</i>, and defied everybody. No one dared to interfere by force, for the man, if attacked,
would have driven his <i lang="ms">kris</i> into the girl’s body. This state of things is said to have lasted three days and
three nights, during which the man neither ate nor slept. Eventually he was drugged
by an old woman from whom he accepted some food or water, and when he fell asleep
the girl was released from his grasp and taken to the Sultan’s palace, where she was
married off straightway to one Mat Arshad. Mat Taib had his revenge, for within a
year he <i>amoked</i> at Bandar, where Mat Arshad lived, killing the latter and wounding Wan Dêna.
</p>
<p>“<i lang="ms">Panjat ’adat</i> is a less lawless proceeding. A man who is in love with a girl, the consent of whose
parents or relations he cannot obtain, sends his <i lang="ms">kris</i> to their house with a message to the effect that he is ready with the dower, presents,
etc., doubled according to custom, and that he is ready to make good any demands they
may make.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">kris</i> is symbolical of the violent entry, which in this case is dispensed with. If the
girl’s guardians are still obdurate they send back the <i lang="ms">kris</i>, but with it they must send double the amount of the dower offered by the man.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19095src" href="#xd32e19095">102</a>”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When a man dies, the corpse (called <i lang="ms">Maiat</i>, except in the case of a Raja, when it is called <i lang="ms">Jĕnaja</i> or <i lang="ms">Jĕnazah</i>) is laid on its back, and composed with the feet towards Mecca, and the hands crossed
(the right wrist resting upon the left just below the breast-bone, and the right fore-finger
on the top of the left arm). It is next shrouded from head to foot in fine new <i>sarongs</i>, one of which usually covers the body from the feet upwards to the waist, the other
covering it from the waist to the head. There are generally (in the case of the peasantry)
three or four thicknesses of these <i>sarongs</i>, but when a rich man (<i lang="ms">orang kaya</i>) dies, as many as seven may be used, each of the seven being made in one long piece,
so as to cover the body from the head to the feet, the cloth being of fine <span class="pageNum" id="pb398">[<a href="#pb398">398</a>]</span>texture, of no recognised colour, but richly interwoven with gold thread, while the
body is laid upon a mattress, which in turn rests upon a new mat of <i lang="ms">pandanus</i> leaf; finally, all but the very poorest display the hangings used on great occasions.
At the head of the corpse are then piled five or six new pillows, with two more on
the right and left side of the body resting against the ribs, while just below the
folded hands are laid a pair of betel-nut scissors (<i lang="ms">kachip bĕsi</i>), and on the matting at either side a bowl for burning incense is placed. Some say
that the origin of laying the betel-nut scissors on the breast is that once upon a
time a cat brushed against the body of a dead person, thereby causing the evil influence
(<i lang="ms">badi</i>) which resides in cats to enter the body, so that it rose and stood upon its feet.
The “contact with iron”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19163src" href="#xd32e19163">104</a> prevents the dead body from rising again should it happen by any mischance that a
cat (which is generally the only animal kept in the house, and which should be driven
out of the house before the funeral ceremonies commence) should enter unawares and
brush against it. From this moment until the body is laid in the grave the “wake”
must be religiously observed, and the body be watched both by day and night to see
that nothing which is forbidden (<i lang="ms">pantang</i>) may come near it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19172src" href="#xd32e19172">105</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb399">[<a href="#pb399">399</a>]</span>The Imām, Bilal, or Khatib, or in their absence the Pah Doja, or Pah Lĕbai, is then
summoned, and early notice of the funeral is given to all relations and friends to
give them an opportunity of attending. Meanwhile the preparations are going on at
the house of the deceased. The shroud (<i lang="ms">kain kapan</i>) and plank or planks for the coffin are got ready: of coffins there are three kinds,
the <i lang="ms">papan sakĕping</i> (the simplest form, generally consisting of a simple plank of <i lang="ms">pulai</i> or <i lang="ms">jĕlutong</i> wood about six feet long by three spans wide), the <i lang="ms">karanda</i> (a plain, oblong plank box, of the same dimensions), and the <i lang="ms">long</i> (consisting either of two planks which form a sort of gable with closed ends called
<i lang="ms">kajang rungkop</i>, or the <i lang="ms">long bĕtul</i>, which is like three sides of a box with its sides bulging out, both ends open, and
no bottom). Varnish or paint is forbidden in Malay coffins, but the planks are washed
to insure their cleanliness, and lined with white cloth (<i lang="ms">alas puteh</i>). About three inches of earth is put into the <i lang="ms">karanda</i> ordinarily, but if the coffin is to be kept, about a span’s depth of earth, quicklime,
and several katis<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19225src" href="#xd32e19225">106</a> of tea-leaves, rush-piths (<i lang="ms">sumbu kumpai</i>), and camphor are also deposited in it, in successive layers, the rush-piths at the
top. Afterwards when the corpse has been laid on the top, tea-leaves are put at front
and back of the corpse as it lies.
</p>
<p>The next operation is to wash the corpse, which is carried for this purpose into the
front or outer room. If there are four people to be found who are willing to undertake
this disagreeable duty, they are told to sit <span class="pageNum" id="pb400">[<a href="#pb400">400</a>]</span>upon the floor in a row, all looking the same way, and with their legs stretched out
(<i lang="ms">bĕlunjor kaki</i>), the body being then laid across their laps (<i lang="ms">riba</i>). Several men are then told off to fetch water in jars, scoop it out of the jars
and pour it on the body in small quantities by means of the “scoop” (<i lang="ms">pĕnchĕdok ayer</i>), which is usually a small bowl, saucer, or cocoa-nut shell (<i lang="ms">tĕmpurong</i>). It frequently happens, however, that this unpleasant task finds no volunteers,
in which case five banana stems are turned into improvised “rollers” (<i lang="ms">galang</i>), on which the body is raised from the floor during the process of washing (<i lang="ms">mĕruang</i>). When the body is ready for washing, a chief washer (<i lang="ms">orang mĕruang</i>) is engaged for a fee of about a dollar; this is usually the Bilal or Imām, who “shampoos”
the body whilst the rest are pouring water on it. The body then undergoes a second
washing, this time with the cosmetic called <i lang="ms">ayer bĕdak</i> which is prepared by taking a handful of rice (<i lang="ms">sa-gĕnggam b’ras</i>), two or three “dips” of lime (<i lang="ms">cholek kapur</i>), and a pinch of gambier (<i lang="ms">gambir sa-chubit</i>)—the last three being the usual concomitants of a single “chew” of the betel-leaf—and
pounding them up together with the rice. When pounded they are mixed with water (<i lang="ms">di-banchor</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19275src" href="#xd32e19275">107</a>) in a large bowl holding about two gallons, the water at the top being poured off
into a vessel of similar capacity, and scooped up and sprinkled as before on the corpse.
The next washing is with juice of limes. Four or five limes (<i lang="ms">limau nipis</i>) are taken, the ends cut off, and each lime slashed crosswise on the top without
completely severing the parts. These limes are then squeezed (<i lang="ms">di-ramaskan</i>) into another large bowl containing water, and the washing repeated. The final washing,
or “Nine Waters” <span class="pageNum" id="pb401">[<a href="#pb401">401</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">ayer sambilan</i>, so called from the water being scooped up, and poured thrice to the right, thrice
to the left, and thrice over the front of the corpse from head to foot) is performed
with fresh water as at first, and the whole ceremony when completed is called <i lang="ms">bĕdara</i>. The washing completed, the orifices—<i>e.g.</i> ears, nostrils, eyes—are generally stopped with cotton, and the body is carried back
to its mattress, and laid in a shroud of white cotton cloth, which should be about
seven feet long by four feet in width (<i lang="ms">salabuh</i>), so that the edges meet over the breast. After this the last kiss is given by the
nearest relatives, <i>who must not, however, disturb the corpse by letting their tears fall upon its features</i>. The shroud is usually of three thicknesses in the case of poor people, but wealthier
families use five, and even seven-fold shrouds. In Selangor, however, each shroud
is usually a separate piece of cloth. The dead body of a child is sometimes covered
in addition with a fine sort of white powder (<i lang="ms">abok tanah</i> or <i lang="ms">tayamam</i>), which is sprinkled over the face and arms. Five knots are used in fastening the
shroud, the ends being drawn up and tied (<i lang="ms">kochong</i>) <i>by means of the unravelled hem or selvage of the shroud torn into tape-like strips</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19318src" href="#xd32e19318">108</a> which are bound thrice round the body at the breast, the knees, and the hips respectively,
as well as above the head and below the feet. The corpse is then laid on the mattress
or mat again, this time with its head to the north, and on its right side looking
towards the west (Mecca), which is the position it is to occupy in the grave. Prayers
are then offered by four or five “praying-men” (<i lang="ms">orang mĕnyĕmbahyang</i>), <span class="pageNum" id="pb402">[<a href="#pb402">402</a>]</span>who know the burial service by heart, the Bilal or Imām joining in the service, and
all turning towards the west in the usual way. One “praying-man” is sufficient, if
no more are to be had, his fee ranging from 50 cents to a dollar in the case of the
poorer classes, and among the rich often amounting to $5 or $6. This service is held
about 1 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> so as to give plenty of time to carry the body to the grave and return before nightfall.
</p>
<p>A jugful of eagle-wood (<i lang="ms">gharu</i>) and sandal-wood (<i lang="ms">chĕndana</i>) water is then prepared, a small piece of each wood being taken and grated on a stone
over the jug until the water becomes appreciably scented; about twenty leaves of the
sweet-scented pandanus (<i lang="ms">pandan wangi</i>) are then added, together with a bunch of fragrant areca-palm blossoms, and other
scented flowers, such as the <i lang="ms">champaka</i> and <i lang="ms">kĕnanga</i>, which are shredded (<i lang="ms">di-iris</i>) into a wooden tray and mixed together, whilst fragrant essences, such as rose-water
(<i lang="ms">ayer mawar</i>), lavender water (<i lang="ms">ayer labenda</i>), attar of roses (<i lang="ms">minyak attar</i> or <i lang="ms">turki</i>) are added when obtainable. A betel-leaf tray containing all the articles required
for chewing betel is then prepared, together with a new mat of pandanus-leaf, in which
are rolled up five <i lang="ms">hasta</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19371src" href="#xd32e19371">109</a> of white cloth, and a brass bowl or alms box, in which latter are to be placed the
contributions (<i lang="ms">sĕdĕkah</i>) of the deceased’s relations. The preparations are completed by bringing in the bier
(<i lang="ms">usongan</i>), which has to be made on purpose, except in towns where a bier is kept in the mosque.
</p>
<p>In the case of the single plank coffin the body is laid on the plank (which is carried
on the bier) and <span class="pageNum" id="pb403">[<a href="#pb403">403</a>]</span>a sort of wicker-work covering (<i lang="ms">lerang-lerang</i>) of split bamboo is placed over the corpse, so as to protect it on its way to the
grave. In the case of the <i lang="ms">karanda</i> the body is laid in the coffin, which is carried on the bier; and in the case of
the <i lang="ms">long</i>, there being no bottom in this form of coffin, the body lies on a mat. In each case
the bier is covered with a pall (<i lang="ms">kain tudong</i>) of as good coloured cloth (<i>never white</i>, but often green) as may be obtainable. There are generally two or three of these
coverings, and floral decorations are sometimes thrown across them, the blossoms of
the areca-palm and the scented pandanus being woven into exquisite floral strips,
called “Centipedes’ Feet” (<i lang="ms">jari lipan</i>), about three feet long by two fingers in breadth, and laid at short intervals across
the pall. There are generally from five to six of these floral strips, the areca blossom
alternating with the pandanus. The number of bearers depends on the rank of the deceased;
in the case of a Sultan as many as possible bear a hand in sending him to the grave,
partly because of the <i lang="ms">pahala</i> or merit thereby obtained, and partly (no doubt) for the sake of the <i lang="ms">sĕdĕkah</i> or alms given to bearers. The procession then starts for the grave; none of the mourners
or followers here wear any special dress or sign of mourning, such as the white sash
with coloured ribbon which is sometimes worn at Singapore (unless the <i lang="ms">kabong puteh</i> or strip of white cloth which is distributed as a funeral favour at the death of
a Sultan may be so reckoned). The only mourning which appears to be known to Malays
is the rare use of a kind of black edging for the envelopes of letters, and that is
no doubt copied from the English custom, though I may add that a letter <span class="pageNum" id="pb404">[<a href="#pb404">404</a>]</span>which announces a death should have no <i lang="ms">kapala</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19417src" href="#xd32e19417">110</a> Loud wailing and weeping is forbidden by the Imām for fear of disturbing the dead.
The mosque drum is not usually beaten for funerals in Selangor, nor is the body usually
carried into the mosque, but is borne straight to the tomb. If the coffin is a single
plank one, on arriving at the grave (which should have been dug early in the morning)
an excavation is made on the left side of the grave for the reception of the corpse,
the cavity being called <i lang="ms">liang lahad</i>. Three men then lower the corpse into the grave, where three others are waiting to
receive it, and the corpse is deposited in the cavity on its right side (<i lang="ms">mĕngiring ka lambong kanan</i>), looking towards the west (Mecca), and with the head therefore lying towards the
north. Four pegs (<i lang="ms">daka-daka</i>) are then driven in to keep the plank in a diagonal position and prevent it from
falling on the body, while the plank in turn protects the corpse from being struck
by falling earth.
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">karanda</i> is lowered into the centre of the grave in the same way as a European coffin, the
body, however, being invariably deposited in the position just described; whilst the
<i lang="ms">long</i> acts as a sort of lid to a shallow trench (just big enough to contain the body) which
is dug (<i lang="ms">di-k’roh</i>) in the middle of the grave-pit. The five bands swathing the corpse (<i lang="ms">lima tali-pĕngikat maiat</i>) are then removed, and at this point the bystanders occasionally hand lumps of earth
(<i lang="ms">tanah sa-kĕpal</i>) to the men standing in the pit, who, after putting them to the nostrils of the deceased
“to be smelled,” deposit them at the side of the grave, when they are shovelled in
by those standing <span class="pageNum" id="pb405">[<a href="#pb405">405</a>]</span>at the top.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19449src" href="#xd32e19449">111</a> The filling of the grave then proceeds, but as it is “taboo” (<i lang="ms">pantang</i>) to let the earth strike against the coffin in its fall, the grave-diggers, who are
still standing in the pit, receive it as it falls upon a sort of small hurdle or screen
made of branches, and thence tilt it into the grave. As the grave (which is usually
dug to about the level of a man’s ear) fills up, the grave-diggers, who are forbidden
to shovel in the soil themselves, tread down the earth and level it, and they are
not allowed to leave the pit till it is filled up to the top. One of the relations
then takes a piece of any hard wood, and rudely fashions with a knife a temporary
grave-post (<i lang="ms">nisan</i> or <i lang="ms">nishan</i>), which is round in the case of a man and flattened in the case of a woman; one of
these grave-posts is placed exactly over the head (<i lang="ms">rantau kapala</i>) and the other over the waist (<i lang="ms">rantau pinggang</i>), not at the feet as in the case of Europeans. Thus the two grave-posts are ordinarily
about three feet apart, but tradition says that over the grave of a <i lang="ms">kramat</i> or saint, they will always be found some five or six feet at least apart, one at
the head and one at the feet, <i>and it is said to be the saint himself who moves them</i>. To the knob of the grave-post is tied a strip of white cloth as a sign of recent
death.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19476src" href="#xd32e19476">112</a>
</p>
<p>Leaves are then strewn on the ground at the left of the grave, and the five cubits
of white cloth alluded <span class="pageNum" id="pb406">[<a href="#pb406">406</a>]</span>to above are spread out to form a mat, upon which the Imām takes his seat, the rest
of the company being seated upon the leaves. Eagle-wood and sandal-wood water (<i lang="ms">ayer gharu chĕndana</i>) is then brought to the Imām, who pours it out in three libations, each time sprinkling
the grave from the head to the foot. If any water is left, the Imām sprinkles it upon
any other graves which may be near, whilst the shredded flowers (<i lang="ms">bunga rampai</i>) are then similarly disposed of. Next is read the <i lang="ms">talkin</i>, which is an exhortation (<i lang="ms">ajaran</i>) addressed to the deceased. <i>It is said</i> that during the process of reading the Talkin <i>the corpse momentarily revives, and, still lying upon its side, raises itself to a
listening position by reclining upon its right elbow</i> (bĕrtĕlku) <i>and resting its head upon its hand.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19505src" href="#xd32e19505">113</a> This is the reason<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19514src" href="#xd32e19514">114</a> for removing the bands of the shroud, as the body is left free to move, and thus
in groping about</i> (mĕraba-raba) <i>with its left hand feels that its garment is without a hem or selvage, and then first
realising that it must be really dead, composes itself to listen quietly to whatever
the Imām may say, until at the close of the exhortation it falls back really lifeless!</i> Hence the most absolute silence must be observed during the exhortation. The Imām
then repeats, by way of “doxology,” the <i lang="ms">tahalil</i> or <i lang="ms">mĕratib</i>, “<i lang="ms">la-ilaha-illa-’llah</i>” (“there is no god but God”), in company with the rest of the assembly, <span class="pageNum" id="pb407">[<a href="#pb407">407</a>]</span>all present turning their heads and rocking themselves from side to side as they sit,
whilst they reiterate the words a hundred times, commencing slowly till thirty-three
times are reached, then increasing the pace up to the sixty-sixth time, and concluding
with great rapidity. The contributions in the alms-basin (<i lang="ms">batil</i>) are then divided among the entire company as alms (<i lang="ms">sĕdĕkah</i>). The master of the house then invites those present to partake at about five p.m.
of the funeral feast, which in no way differs from an ordinary Malay banquet, the
more solid portion of the meal (<i lang="ms">makan nasi</i>) being followed by the usual confectionery and preserved fruits. The Imām then reads
prayers, and the company breaks up. The decorations for the funeral are left for three
days undisturbed. During these three days the nearer neighbours are feasted, both
in the morning and evening, at the usual Malay hours; and for three days every night
at about ten <span class="sc">P.M.</span> the service called “Reading the Korān to the Corpse” (<i lang="ms">mĕngajikan maiat</i>) is performed, either by the Imām or somebody hired for the purpose. This is an important
duty, the slightest slip being regarded as a great sin. At the end of the three days
there is yet another feast, at one <span class="sc">P.M.</span> (<i lang="ms">kanduri mĕniga hari</i>), when those who are farther off are invited, and after this meal the <i lang="ms">tahalil</i> is repeated as before.
</p>
<p>On the seventh day a similar feast (called <i lang="ms">kanduri mĕnujoh hari</i>) is followed by the <i lang="ms">tahalil</i>, which necessitates a further distribution of fees (<i lang="ms">sĕdĕkah tahalil</i>); but in the case of poor people this second <i lang="ms">tahalil</i> may be omitted, or the master of the house may say to the company, “I ask (to be
let off) the praying fees” (<i lang="ms">Sahya minta’ sĕdĕkah tahalil</i>), in which case the <i lang="ms">tahalil</i> is free.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb408">[<a href="#pb408">408</a>]</span></p>
<p>Yet another feast is held on the fourteenth day (<i lang="ms">kanduri dua kali tujoh hari</i>), when the ceremonies are at end, except in the case of the richer classes who keep
the <i lang="ms">kanduri ampat puloh hari</i>, or forty days’ feast, and the <i lang="ms">kanduri mĕratus hari</i>, or 100 days’ feast, whilst the anniversary is also kept as a holiday by all who
wish to show respect for the deceased. This closes the usual funeral ceremonies, but
a day is generally chosen at pleasure in the month of Ramthan or Maulud for the purpose
of offering prayers and feasting the ancestors.
</p>
<p>The only difference made in the case of the death of a woman is that the washing of
the corpse devolves upon women, whilst in the case of very young infants the <i lang="ms">talkin</i> is sometimes omitted. The woman’s <i lang="ms">nisan</i>, as has been explained, is distinguished by its shape.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19604src" href="#xd32e19604">115</a> The temporary <i lang="ms">nisan</i> may be replaced by a permanent one at any time after the funeral. At the time the
grave is made up, four planks (<i lang="ms">dapor-dapor</i>), with the upper edges and ends roughly carved and scalloped, are placed round the
grave mound (<i lang="ms">tanah mati</i>) to keep the earth from falling down. Whenever the grave is thus finally made up
a feast is held, but from the necessities of the case this pious duty is generally
left to the rich.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The successful practice of (Malay) medicine must be based on the fundamental principle
of ‘preserving the balance of power’ among the four elements. This is chiefly to be
effected by constant attention to, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb409">[<a href="#pb409">409</a>]</span>moderation in, diet. To enforce these golden precepts, passages from the Korān are
plentifully quoted against excess in eating or drinking. Air, they say, is the cause
of heat and moisture, and earth of cold and dryness. They assimilate the constitution
and passions of man to the twelve signs of the Zodiac, and the seven planets, etc.”
</p>
<p>“The mysterious sympathy between man and external nature … was the basis of that system
of supernatural magic which prevailed in Europe during the Middle Ages.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19628src" href="#xd32e19628">116</a>
</p>
<p>The foregoing quotation shows that the distinctive features of the Aristotelian hygienic
theory, as borrowed by the Arabs, did eventually filter through (in some cases) until
they reached the Malays. Such direct references, however, to Greek theories are of
the rarest character, and can hardly be considered typical.
</p>
<p>Most of the more important rites practised by the Malay medicine-men (<i lang="ms">Bomor</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19638src" href="#xd32e19638">117</a>) may be divided into two well-defined parts. Commencing with a ceremonial “inspection”
(the counterpart of our modern “diagnosis”), the Bomor proceeds to carry out a therapeutic
ceremony, the nature of which is decided by the results of the “inspection.” For the
purposes of the diagnosis he resorts to divination, by means of omens taken from the
smoke of the burning censer, from the position of coins thrown into water-jars (<i lang="ms">batu buyong</i>), and parched rice floating upon the water’s surface.
</p>
<p>The therapeutic rites, on the other hand, may be roughly classified as follows according
to their types:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19655src" href="#xd32e19655">118</a>—

<p class="first">Model, showing a medicine-man (<i lang="ms">bomor</i> or <i lang="ms">pawang</i>) at work, the patient lying in bed with his child at his side. The “three jars” (<i lang="ms">buyong tiga</i>) used by the medicine-man are standing in a row at the side of the room. They are
a little too large in proportion.
</p>
<p><i>Page 410.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>I shall take each of the types in order.
</p>
<p>For the water-jar ceremony three jars (<i lang="ms">buyong</i>) containing water are brought to the sick man’s room and decorated with the fringe
or necklace of plaited cocoa-nut leaves, which is called “Centipedes’ Feet” (<i lang="ms">jari ’lipan</i>). A fourth jar should contain a sort of bouquet of artificial flowers to serve as
an attraction to the sick man’s soul (<i lang="ms">sĕmangat</i>). You will also require a tray filled with the usual accessories of Malay magic ceremonies
(incense, three sorts of rice, etc.), besides three wax tapers, one of which you will
plant upon the brim of each of the three jars.
</p>
<p>When all is ready, drop the incense upon the embers, and as the smoke rises repeat
this charm:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“If you are at one with me, rise towards me, O smoke;
</p>
<p class="line">If you are not at one with me, rise athwart me, O smoke,
</p>
<p class="line">Either to right or left.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19745src" href="#xd32e19745">120</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">As you say this, “catch” the first puff of smoke and <span class="pageNum" id="pb411">[<a href="#pb411">411</a>]</span>inhale it (<i lang="ms">tangkap-lah puchok asap, chium</i>), as it rises towards you. If the smell is pleasant (<i lang="ms">sĕdap</i>) it is a good sign; if it has a scorched smell (<i lang="ms">hangit</i>) it is bad; but if it smells offensive (<i lang="ms">busok</i>) no medicine can save the patient.
</p>
<p>Next, before you look into the jars, take handfuls of “parched,” “washed,” and “saffron”
rice, and after fumigating them over the incense, strew them all round the row of
jars, saying as you do so:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Cluck, cluck! souls of <i>So-and-so</i>, all seven of you!<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19771src" href="#xd32e19771">121</a>
</p>
<p class="line">Come, and let all of us here together
</p>
<p class="line">See (about the) medicine for (you) O souls of <i>So-and-so</i>.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here strew (<i lang="ms">tabor</i>) the rice first to the right, then to the left, and then to the right again.
</p>
<p>Before removing the calladium-leaves from the jar-mouths, repeat the following:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, Prophet ’Tap, in whose charge is the earth,
</p>
<p class="line">Suawam, in whose charge are the heavens,
</p>
<p class="line">Prophet Noah, in whose charge are the Trees,
</p>
<p class="line">Prophet Elias, Planter of Trees,
</p>
<p class="line">And Prophet Khailir (Khizr), in whose charge is the water,
</p>
<p class="line">I crave permission to see the remedies for <i>So-and-so</i>.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here remove the calladium-leaves from the jar-mouths, and taking one of the wax tapers,
wave it in the smoke of the censer seven times towards the right, and say:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, O Tanju, I adopt you to be a guardian for my brother,
</p>
<p class="line">You who are sprung from the original elements,
</p>
<p class="line">From the former time unto the present,
</p>
<p class="line">You who sprang from the gum of the eyes of Muhammad,
</p>
<p class="line">I ask to see the disease of <i>So-and-so</i>.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here plant the taper firmly upon the edge of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb412">[<a href="#pb412">412</a>]</span>jar, and “gaze” into the water “to see the signs” (<i lang="ms">ʿalamat-nya</i>).
</p>
<p>Thus if there is an oily scum on the water (<i lang="ms">ayer bĕrk’rak lĕmak</i>) it is a bad sign; and to this may be added that if the calladium-leaf covering has
acquired a faded look (<i lang="ms">layu</i>) in the interim, it is a sign of severe sickness.
</p>
<p>Fumigate the outside of the jars with the smoke of the incense (the medicine-man does
this by “washing” his hands in the smoke and then rubbing over the outside of the
jars as if he were “shampooing” them); and anoint them with “oil of Celebes” (<i lang="ms">minyak Bugis</i>). Then take a “closed fistful” (<i lang="ms">sa-gĕnggam</i>) of parched rice, and holding it over the smoke of the censer (<i lang="ms">ganggang di asap kĕm’nyan</i>), repeat this charm:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, Mustia Kĕmbang,
</p>
<p class="line">I adopt you as a guardian for my brother,
</p>
<p class="line">If in truth you are sprung from the primordial elements,

<p class="line">You break neither plighted faith nor solemn promise.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here throw the parched rice into the jars, and say:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</p>
<p class="line">I crave this water (lit. ‘exudation’) as a boon,
</p>
<p class="line">For the healing of <i>So-and-so</i>.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And observe these signs:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1.</span> If the water is perfectly still it is a bad sign.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2.</span> If it is a little disturbed it is a good sign.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb413">[<a href="#pb413">413</a>]</span></li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">3.</span> If the rice floats in a line across the sun’s path (<i lang="ms">bĕrator mĕlintang matahari</i>) it is a fatal sign.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">4.</span> If you see a solitary grain travelling by itself (<i lang="ms">bĕrsiar</i>) you may know the sickness to be caused by the making of an image (<i lang="ms">buatan orang</i>).
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">5.</span> If the parched rice travels towards the right of the jar the patient will recover
quickly.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">6.</span> If it travels towards the left of the jar he will recover, but slowly.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">7.</span> If, however, it floats right underneath the candle it is generally a fatal sign.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Next, see what patterns are formed by the rice-grains as they lie on the water:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1.</span> If they take the shape either of a boat or a crocodile, this means that the spirit
demands the launching of a spirit-boat (<i lang="ms">lanchang</i>).

<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2.</span> If they take a square shape, a tray of offerings (<i lang="ms">anchak</i>) is demanded.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">3.</span> If they take the shape of a house, a ‘state-hall’ (<i lang="ms">balei</i>) is demanded.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Now take all kinds of fragrant flowers and shred them (<i lang="ms">buat bunga rampai</i>), add the shredded blossoms of four which are scentless (for instance, blossoms of
the <i lang="ms">sĕlaguri</i>, <i lang="ms">pulut-pulut</i>, <i lang="ms">bali-adap</i>, and <i lang="ms">kĕdudok</i>), mix them and throw them into the jars, then plant in each jar the flower-spathe
of an areca-palm (<i lang="ms">mayang pinang</i>). Throw into each a “jar-stone” (<i>i.e.</i> a dollar), and the jars will be ready. You should then read the foregoing charms
over each of them.
</p>
<p>The extra jar which is filled with a sort of big nosegay (<i lang="ms">gumba</i>) represents a pleasure-garden (<i lang="ms">taman bunga</i>), and is intended to attract the soul (<i lang="ms">sĕmangat</i>) of the sick man.
</p>
<p>Now take parched rice and hold it over the incense (<i lang="ms">di-ganggang</i>) saying:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</ul><p>
</p>
<p>The most popular method of propitiating evil spirits consists in the use of the sacrificial
tray called Anchak.
</p>
<p>This is “a small frame of bamboo or wood,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20044src" href="#xd32e20044">122</a> usually from two to three feet square and turned up at the sides, which are decorated
with a long fringe (<i lang="ms">jari’lipan</i>) of plaited cocoa-nut leaf. Four rattan “suspenders” of equal length (<i lang="ms">tali pĕnggantong</i>) are fastened to the four corners, and are thence carried up to meet at a point which
may be from two to three feet above the tray.
</p>
<p>These trays appear to be divisible into two classes, according to the objects which
they are intended to serve. In the one case certain offerings (to <span class="pageNum" id="pb415">[<a href="#pb415">415</a>]</span>be described presently) are laid upon the tray, which is carried out of the house
to a suitable spot and there suspended to enable the spirits for whom it is designed
to feed upon its contents.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20057src" href="#xd32e20057">123</a> In the other case certain objects are deposited upon it, into which the evil spirits
are ceremoniously invited to enter, in which case it must obviously be got rid of
after the ceremony, and is therefore hung up in the jungle, or set adrift in the sea
or the nearest river; in the latter case it is called the “keeled sacrifice-tray”
(<i lang="ms">anchak pĕlunas</i>), and falls into line with other objects which are occasionally set adrift for the
same purpose.
</p>
<p>The offerings placed on the sacrificial tray vary considerably, according to the object
of the ceremony, the means of the person for whose benefit they are offered, the caprice
of the medicine-man who carries out the ceremony, and so on.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20075src" href="#xd32e20075">124</a>
</p>
<p>I shall therefore, in the present place, merely describe the contents of a more or
less typical tray, with the main points of the accompanying ritual.
</p>
<p>The bottom of the tray having been lined with banana-leaf, and thickly strewn with
parched rice, there are deposited in the tray itself five “chews” of betel-leaf, five
native “cigarettes” (<i lang="ms">rokok</i>), five wax tapers, five small water-receptacles or <i lang="ms">limas</i> (made of banana-leaf and skewered together at each end), and five copper cents (or
dollars). The articles just enumerated are divided into five portions, one of which
<span class="pageNum" id="pb416">[<a href="#pb416">416</a>]</span>is deposited in the centre of the tray, and the remainder in its four corners. Besides
this there are to be deposited in the tray fourteen portions of meat (of fowl, goat,
or buffalo, as the case may be), and fourteen portions of Malay “cakes,” care being
taken in each case to see that there are seven portions of cooked and seven portions
of uncooked food provided. The rattan “suspenders,” again, are hung with two sets
of ornamental rice-receptacles made of plaited cocoa-nut leaf (fourteen of the long-shaped
kind, or <i lang="ms">lĕpat</i>, and fourteen of the diamond-shaped kind, or <i lang="ms">kĕtupat</i>). Besides this, two sets of (cooked and uncooked) packets of rice (each stained a
different colour) are sometimes deposited in the tray, the colours used being white,
yellow, red, black, blue, green, and purple. The only other articles required for
the tray are a couple of eggs, of which one must, of course, be cooked and the other
raw.
</p>
<p>Of the water-receptacles, those in alternate corners are filled with water and cane-juice,
the central receptacle being filled with the blood of the fowl (or other animal slain
for the sacrifice).
</p>
<p>Upon the ground, exactly underneath the tray, should be deposited the feathers, feet,
entrails, etc., of the fowl, portions of whose flesh have been used for the tray,
together with the refuse of the parched rice and a censer. Strictly speaking, a white
and a black fowl should be killed, but only half of each cooked, the remainder being
left raw. The “portions” of fowl are as small as they can possibly be, a mere symbol
(<i lang="ms">ʿisharat</i>) of each kind of food being all that the spirits are supposed to require. Sometimes
funnel-shaped rice-receptacles are used, which are skewered with a bamboo skewer and
called <i lang="ms">kĕronchot</i>. Occasionally <span class="pageNum" id="pb417">[<a href="#pb417">417</a>]</span>a standard censer (<i lang="ms">sangga?</i>) is used, the end of a piece of bamboo being split up and bent or opened outwards
for several inches, and a piece of rattan (cane) being wound in and out among the
split ends, so as to form a sort of funnel (about nine inches in diameter at the top),
which is lined with banana leaf, filled with earth, and planted vertically in the
ground, great care being taken to see that it does not lean out of the perpendicular.
Live embers are placed upon it, incense crumbled over it (between the finger and thumb),
and the appropriate charm recited. A specimen of a charm or formula used during the
burning of incense will be found in the Appendix.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20113src" href="#xd32e20113">125</a>
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">kĕtupats</i> are called—(1) <i lang="ms">S’ri nĕg’ri</i> (seven-cornered), or the “luck of the country”; (2) <i lang="ms">Buah k’ras</i> (six-cornered), or the “candle-nut”; (3) <i lang="ms">Bawang puteh</i> (six-cornered), or “garlic”; (4) <i lang="ms">Ulu pĕngayoh</i> (four-cornered), or the “paddle-handle”; (5) <i lang="ms">Pasar</i> (five-cornered), or the “market”; (6) <i lang="ms">Bawang merah</i> (six-cornered), or the “onion”; (7) <i lang="ms">Pasar Pahang</i> (six-cornered), or the “Pahang market”; (8) <i lang="ms">Tĕlor</i>, or the “hen’s egg.”
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">lĕpats</i> are called—(1) <i lang="ms">Lĕpat daun niyor</i> (5–6 inches long and made of cocoa-nut leaves); (2) <i lang="ms">Lĕpat tilam</i> (of plantain leaves); (3) <i lang="ms">Lĕpat daun palas</i> (of <i lang="ms">palas</i> leaves, three-sided).
</p>
<p>Diminutive models of various objects (also made of cocoa-nut leaves) are often added,
<i>e.g.</i> <i lang="ms">burong ponggok</i>, the owl; <i lang="ms">kĕr’bau</i>, the buffalo; <i lang="ms">rusa</i>, the stag; <i lang="ms">tĕkukur</i>, the ground-dove; <i lang="ms">kĕtam</i>, the crab; and (but very rarely) <i lang="ms">kuda</i>, the horse.
</p>
<p>The things deposited in the tray are intended for the spirits (Hantus) themselves;
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb418">[<a href="#pb418">418</a>]</span>refuse on the ground beneath it for their slaves (<i lang="ms">hamba</i>).
</p>
<p>Of the food in the tray, the cooked food is for the king of the spirits (<i lang="ms">Raja Hantu</i>), who is sometimes said to be the Wild Huntsman (<i lang="ms">Hantu Pĕmburu</i>) and sometimes <i lang="ms">Batara Guru</i>, and the uncooked for his following. But of the two eggs, the uncooked one is alleged
to be for the Land-spirit (<i>i.e.</i> the Wild Huntsman), and the cooked for the Sea-spirit; this assertion, however, requires
some further investigation before it can be unreservedly accepted.

<h4 class="main"><i>The Wave-Offering</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On one occasion, during my residence in the Kuala Langat district of Selangor, I had
the good fortune to be present at the “waving” of a sacrificial tray (<i lang="ms">anchak</i>) containing offerings to the spirits. The account of this ceremony, which I shall
now give, is made up from notes taken during the actual performance. To commence:—The
Pawang sat down with his back to the patient, facing a multitude of dishes which contained
the various portions of cooked and uncooked food. The tray itself was suspended at
a height of about three feet from the ground in the centre of the room, just in front
of the Pawang’s head. Lighting a wax taper and removing the yam-leaf covering from
the mouth of the jar containing “holy” water, the Pawang now “inspected” the water
in the jar by gazing intently into its depths, and re-extinguished the taper. Then
he fumigated his hands in the smoke of the censer, extended them for a brief interval
over the “holy” water, took the censer in both hands, described three circles round
the jar with it, set it down again, <span class="pageNum" id="pb419">[<a href="#pb419">419</a>]</span>and stirred the water thrice with a small knife or dagger (<i lang="ms">k’ris</i>), the blade of which he kept in the water while he muttered a charm to himself. Then
he charmed the betel-stand and the first dish of cooked food, pushing the latter aside
and covering it with a small dish-cover as he finished the charm. Next, at the hands
of one of the company, he accepted, in two pieces, five cubits of yellow cloth (yellow
being the royal colour), and a small vessel of “oil of Celebes,” with which, it may
be added, he anointed the palms of both hands before he touched the cloth itself.
Next, he fumigated the latter in the smoke of the censer, one end of the cloth being
grasped firmly in the right hand, and the remainder of it being passed round the right
wrist, and over and under the right arm, while the loose end trailed across his lap.
Next, after repeating the usual charm, he breathed on one end of the cloth, passed
the whole of the cloth through his fingers, fumigated it, and laid it aside; took
an egg which was presented to him upon a tray, and deposited it exactly in the centre
of a large dish of parched rice. Next, he pushed aside the jar of holy water, lowered
the tray by means of the cord attached to it (which passed over a beam), and proceeded
to supervise the preparation of the tray, which was being decorated with the “centipede”
fringe by one of the company acting as an assistant. The fringe having been fitted
by the latter to the edges of the tray, and the latter lined with three thicknesses
of banana leaf, the Pawang described a circle round it thrice with the censer, and
then deposited the censer upon the floor, exactly under the centre of the tray. Then
anointing his hands again he passed them over both tray and fringe. A brief pause
followed, and then the Pawang took the larger piece of <span class="pageNum" id="pb420">[<a href="#pb420">420</a>]</span>yellow cloth and wrapped it like a royal robe around the shoulders of the patient
as he sat up inside his mosquito curtain. Another brief pause, and the Pawang betook
himself once more to the filling of the tray. Taking a large bowl of parched rice,
he scooped up the rice in his hands, and let it run through his fingers into the tray,
until there was a layer of parched rice in the latter of at least an inch in depth,
and then deposited the egg, already alluded to, in the very centre of the parched
rice. Next he took a comb of bananas (presented by one of the company), and cutting
them off one by one deposited them in a dish, from which they were presently transferred
to the tray. The Pawang now returned to the patient, and kneeling down in front of
him, fumigated his hands in the smoke of the censer, and then, muttering a charm,
wrapped the smaller piece of yellow cloth turban-wise round his own head, and slowly
and carefully pushed the yellow-robed patient (who was still in a sitting posture)
forward until he reached a spot which was exactly under the centre of the tray, and
which faced, I was told, the “place of the Rising Sun.”
</p>
<p>The long straw-coloured streamers of the tray-fringe dropped gracefully around the
patient on every side, and had it not been for occasional bright glimpses of the yellow
cloth he would have been almost invisible.
</p>
<p>The censer, voluming upwards its ash-gray smoke, was now passed from hand to hand
three times round the patient, and finally deposited on the floor at his feet.
</p>
<p>The loading of the tray now recommenced, and the Pawang standing up and looking towards
the south, deposited in it carefully the several portions of <span class="pageNum" id="pb421">[<a href="#pb421">421</a>]</span>“cooked” offerings (the sum of the various portions making up a whole fowl). Then,
after washing his hands, he added to the tray small portions of rice variously prepared
and coloured (viz. parched and washed rice, and rice stained yellow (saffron), green,
red, blue, and black, seven kinds in all). Next he deposited in the tray the uncooked
portions, whose sum also amounted to a whole fowl, then, after a further hand-washing,
the “cakes,” and finally, after a last washing, he fastened to the “suspenders”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20232src" href="#xd32e20232">126</a> of the tray the small ornamental rice-bags called <i lang="ms">kĕtupat</i> and <i lang="ms">lĕpat</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20244src" href="#xd32e20244">127</a>
</p>
<p>But the list of creature comforts provided for the spirits comprised other things
besides food. Five miniature water-buckets, each manufactured from a strip of banana
leaf skewered together at each end with a bamboo pin, were now filled, the alternate
corner ones with water and cane-juice (called “palm-toddy” in the Spirit Language),
and the central one with the blood of the fowls killed for the sacrifice. They were
then duly deposited in the tray by the Pawang. Five waxen tapers, to “light the spirits
to their food,” were next “charmed” and lighted, and planted in the centre and four
corners respectively.
</p>
<p>Finally, no doubt for the spirits’ after-dinner enjoyment, five “chews” of betel-leaf
and five native-made cigarettes (tobacco rolled in strips of palm-leaf), were charmed
and actually lighted at a lamp, and deposited in the tray with the other offerings,
and at the same <span class="pageNum" id="pb422">[<a href="#pb422">422</a>]</span>time five 50 cent (silver) pieces of Straits money, called “tray-stones,” were added
to the medley, evidently with the object of preventing the good temper of the spirits
from being disturbed by “shortness of cash.”
</p>
<p>The loading of the tray being now complete, the Pawang walked thrice round the patient
(who was still overshadowed by the tray), and passed the censer round him thrice.
Standing then with his face to the east, so as to look in the same direction as the
patient, he grasped the “suspenders” of the tray with both hands at their converging
point, and thrice muttered a charm, giving a downward tug to the cord of the tray
at the end of each repetition. This done, he removed the yellow cloth from his head,
and fastened it round the tray-cord at the point where the “suspenders” converged,
and then “<i>waved</i>” the offering by causing the loaded tray with its flaring tapers to swing slowly
backwards and forwards just over the patient’s head. Next, letting the tray slowly
down and detaching it from the cord, at the converging point, he again “<i>waved</i>” it slowly to and fro amid the flaring of the tapers, seven times in succession,
and held it out for the patient to spit into. When this was done he sallied out into
the darkness of the night carrying the tray, and gaining the jungle, suspended it
from a tree (of the kind called <i lang="ms">pĕtai bĕlalang</i>) which had been selected that very day for the purpose. A white ant, immediately
settling upon the offering, was hailed by the Malays present with great delight as
a sign that the spirits had accepted the offering, whereupon we all returned to the
house and the company broke up. The ceremony had commenced about 8 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, and lasted about an hour and a half, and the number of people <span class="pageNum" id="pb423">[<a href="#pb423">423</a>]</span>present was fourteen, seven male and seven female, which was the number stipulated
by the Pawang.
</p>
<p>Another form of “propitiation” (<i lang="ms">buang-buangan limas</i>) ceremony consists in loading a <i lang="ms">limas</i> with the offerings. The <i lang="ms">limas</i> is a receptacle of about a span (<i lang="ms">sa-jĕngkal</i>) in length, made of banana-leaf folded together at the ends and skewered with a bamboo
pin. Inside it are deposited the offerings, which consist of the following articles:
a <i lang="ms">chupak</i> (half cocoa-nutful) of “parched” rice, a set of three, five, or seven bananas, a
“pinch” (<i lang="ms">sa-jĕmput</i>) of “saffron” rice, a pinch of “washed” rice, a native cigarette (<i lang="ms">rokok</i>), an egg, a wax taper, two “chews” of betel-leaf, and a betel-leaf twisted up into
the shape of a spiral (<i lang="ms">pantat siput</i>). One (at least) of the two “chews” of betel must be specially prepared, as it is
to be left behind for the spirits to chew, whilst the other is taken back into the
presence of the sick man, where the medicine-man chews it and ejects the chewed leaf
(<i lang="ms">di-sĕmbor</i>) upon the “small” of the sick man’s back. In the case of the “chew” which is left
behind for the spirits, the ordinary portion of betel-nut must be replaced by nutmeg,
the gambier by mace, and the lime by “oil of Celebes” (<i lang="ms">minyak Bugis</i>).
</p>
<p>When the ceremony of loading the <i lang="ms">limas</i> is complete, it is carried down to the nearest river or sea, and there set adrift
with the following words:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, Khailir (Khizr), Prophet of God and Lord of water,
</p>
<p class="line">Maduraya is the name of your sire,
</p>
<p class="line">Madaruti the name of your mother,
</p>
<p class="line">Si Kĕkas the name of their child;
</p>
<p class="line">Accept this present from your younger brother, Si Kĕkas,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb424">[<a href="#pb424">424</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Cause him no sickness or headache.
</p>
<p class="line">Here is his, your younger brother’s, present.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here the <i lang="ms">limas</i> is set adrift, and the water underneath it scooped up and carried home, where it
is used for bathing the sick man.
</p>
<p>Another very simple form of “propitiation” is called <i lang="ms">ambang-ambangan</i>, and is performed as follows:—
</p>
<p>Take seven “chews” of betel-leaf, seven native cigarettes (<i lang="ms">rokok</i>), seven bananas, an egg, and an overflowing <i lang="ms">chupak</i> (half cocoa-nutful) of parched rice (<i lang="ms">bĕr’tih sa-chupak abong</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20351src" href="#xd32e20351">128</a> roll them all up together in a banana leaf (which must be a cubit in length and of
the same variety of banana as the first), and deposit them in a place where three
roads meet (if anything “a little way along the left-hand road of the three,”) and
repeat this charm:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Jĕmbalang Jĕmbali, Demon of the Earth,
</p>
<p class="line">Accept this portion as your payment
</p>
<p class="line">And restore <i>So-and-So</i>.
</p>
<p class="line">But if you do not restore him
</p>
<p class="line">I shall curse you with the saying,
</p>
<p class="line">‘There is no god but God,’ ” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The above ceremony is generally used in the case of fever complaint.
</p>
<p>Counter-charms for “neutralising” the active principle of poisons form, as a rule,
one of the most important branches of the pharmacopœic system among the less civilised
Malay tribes. A settled form of government and the softening of manners due to contact
with European civilisation has, however, diminished the importance (I speak, of course,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb425">[<a href="#pb425">425</a>]</span>from the Malay point of view) of this branch of the subject in the Western Malay States
of the Peninsula, where poisoning cases are very rarely heard of. Malay women have
always possessed the reputation of being especially proficient in the use of poison;
ground glass and the furry spicules obtained from the leaf-cases of some kinds of
bamboo being their favourite weapons.
</p>
<p>This idea (of using a charm to “neutralise” the active principle of poison) has been
extended by Malay medicine-men to cover all cases where any evil principle (even,
for instance, a familiar spirit) is believed to have entered the sick person’s system.
All such charms are piously regarded by devout Muhammadans as gifts due to the mercy
of God, who is believed to have sent them down to the Prophet Muhammad by the hand
of his servant Gabriel. This doctrine we find clearly stated in the charms themselves,
<i>e.g.</i> (somewhat tautologically):—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Neutralising charms sprang from God,
</p>
<p class="line">Neutralising charms were created by God,
</p>
<p class="line">Neutralising charms were a boon from God,
</p>
<p class="line">Who commanded Prince Gabriel
</p>
<p class="line">To bring them unto Muhammad.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The ceremony of applying such charms generally takes the form of grating a bezoar-stone<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20386src" href="#xd32e20386">129</a> (<i lang="ms">batu guliga</i>), mixing the result with water, and drinking it after repeating the charm.
</p>
<p>Thus in one of the charms quoted in the Appendix we read:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“The Upas loses its venom,
</p>
<p class="line">And Poison loses its venom,
</p>
<p class="line">And the Sea-Snake loses its venom,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb426">[<a href="#pb426">426</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">And the poison-tree of Borneo loses its venom,
</p>
<p class="line">Everything that is venomous loses its venom,
</p>
<p class="line">By virtue of my use of the <i>Prayer of the Magic Bezoar-Stone</i>.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Of the sea-snake (<i lang="ms">ular gerang</i>) I was told that it was about two cubits in length, and that it was the most poisonous
snake in existence; “In fact,” my informant declared, “if your little finger is bitten
by it you must cut off the finger; if your oar-blade is bitten by it you must throw
away the oar.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20415src" href="#xd32e20415">130</a> And again of the Ipoh, or “upas” (which is one of the chief ingredients in the blow-gun
poison used by the wild tribes), I was told that if a man who was “struck” by it was
supported by another his supporter would die, and that so far from its virulence becoming
then exhausted, it would even kill a person who was seven times removed, in point
of contact, from the person originally affected.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20422src" href="#xd32e20422">131</a>
</p>
<p>The above charm terminates as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Let this my prayer be sharp as steel,
</p>
<p class="line">Swift as lightning,
</p>
<p class="line">Fleet as the wind!
</p>
<p class="line">Grant this by virtue of my use of the prayer of Dato’ Malim Karimun,
</p>
<p class="line">Who has become a saint through religious penance
</p>
<p class="line">Performed at the headwaters of the river of Saïran in the interior of Egypt,
</p>
<p class="line">By the grace of,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">I may add that when you are collecting the materials for a neutralising ceremony (<i lang="ms">tawar</i>) the following formula should be used:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb427">[<a href="#pb427">427</a>]</span>

<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Badi</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The next class of medicinal ceremonies consists of rites intended to effect the expulsion
from the patient’s body of all kinds of evil influences or principles, such as may
have entered into a man who has unguardedly touched a dead animal or bird from which
the <i lang="ms">badi</i> has not yet been expelled, or who has met with the Wild Huntsman in the forest.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20467src" href="#xd32e20467">133</a>
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Badi</i> is the name given to the evil principle which, according to the view of Malay medicine-men,
attends (like an evil angel) everything that has life. [It must not be forgotten when
we find it used of inert objects, such as trees, and even of stones or minerals, that
these too are animate objects from the Malay point of view.] Von de Wall describes
it as “the enchanting or destroying influence which issues from anything, <i>e.g.</i> from a tiger which one sees,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20480src" href="#xd32e20480">134</a> from a poison-tree which one passes under, from the saliva of a mad dog, from an
action which one has performed; the contagious principle of morbid matter.”
</p>
<p>Hence the ceremony which purports to drive out this evil principle is of no small
importance in Malay <span class="pageNum" id="pb428">[<a href="#pb428">428</a>]</span>medicine. I may take this opportunity of pointing out that I have used the word “mischief”
to translate it when dealing with the charms, as this is the nearest English equivalent
which I have been able to find; indeed, it appears a very fairly exact equivalent
when we remember its use in English in such phrases as “It’s got the mischief in it,”
which is sometimes used even of inanimate objects.
</p>
<p>There are a hundred and ninety of these mischiefs, according to some, according to
others, a hundred and ninety-three. Their origin is very variously given. One authority
says that the first <i lang="ms">badi</i> sprang from three drops of Adam’s blood (which were spilt on the ground). Another
(rather inconsistently) declares that the “mischief” (<i lang="ms">badi</i>) residing in an iguana (<i lang="ms">biawak</i>) was the origin of all subsequent “mischiefs,” yet adds later that the “Heart of
Timber” was their origin, and yet again that the yellow glow at sunset (called Mambang
Kuning or the “Yellow Deity”) was their origin. These two latter are, perhaps the
most usual theories, but a third medicine-man declares that the first <i lang="ms">badi</i> was the offspring of the Jin (“genie”) Ibn Ujan (Ibnu Jan?), who resides in the clouds
(or caverns?) and hollows of the hills. Thus do Malay medicine-men disagree.
</p>
<p>These “mischiefs” reside not only in animate, but also in inanimate objects. Thus
in one of the elephant-charms given in the Appendix several different “mischiefs”
are described as residing in earth, ant-hills, wood, water, stone, and elephants (or
rhinoceroses) respectively. Again, in a deer-charm, various “mischiefs” are requested
to return to their place of origin, <i>i.e.</i> to the Iguana (strictly speaking, the Monitor Lizard), Heart of Timber, and the Yellow
Glow of <span class="pageNum" id="pb429">[<a href="#pb429">429</a>]</span>Sunset. Yet another deer-charm calls upon “Badi” (as the offspring of the Jin Ibn
Ujan, who resides in the clouds and hollows of the hills), to return thereto.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20522src" href="#xd32e20522">135</a>
</p>
<p>I will now proceed to describe the ceremony of “casting out” these “mischiefs.”
</p>
<p>The chief occasions on which this casting out takes place are, first, when somebody
is ill, and his sickness is attributed to his accidental contact with (and consequent
“possession by”) one of these mischiefs; and, secondly, when any wild animal or bird
is killed. The ceremony of casting out the mischief from the carcases of big game
will be found described under the heading of “Hunting Ceremonies.” I shall here confine
myself to a brief description of the ceremony as conducted for the benefit of sick
persons.
</p>
<p>First make up a bunch of leaves (<i lang="ms">sa-chĕrek</i>), consisting of the shrubs called <i lang="ms">pulut-pulut</i> and <i lang="ms">sĕlaguri</i>, with branches of the <i lang="ms">gandarusa</i> and <i lang="ms">lĕnjuang merah</i> (red dracæna), all of which are wrapped together in a leaf of the <i lang="ms">si-pulih</i>, and tied round with a piece of tree-bark (<i lang="ms">kulit t’rap</i>), or the <i lang="ms">akar gasing-gasing</i>. With this leaf-brush you are to cast out the mischief. Then you grate on to a saucer
small pieces of ebony wood, brazil wood, “<i lang="ms">laka</i>” wood, sandalwood, and eagle-wood (lignaloes), mix them with water, putting in a
few small pieces of scrap-iron, and rub the patient all over with the mixture.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb430">[<a href="#pb430">430</a>]</span></p>
<p>As you do this, repeat the appropriate charm; then take the brush of leaves and stroke
the patient all over downwards from head to foot, saying:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, Prophet Noah, to whom belong the trees,
</p>
<p class="line">And Prophet Elias who planted them.
</p>
<p class="line">I crave as a boon the leaves of these shrubs
</p>
<p class="line">To be a drug and a neutralising (power)
</p>
<p class="line">Within the body, frame, and person of <i>So-and-So</i>.
</p>
<p class="line">If you (addressing the leaves) refuse to enter (the body of <i>So-and-So</i>),
</p>
<p class="line">You shall be cursed with my ‘curse of the nine countries,’
</p>
<p class="line">By (the power of) the word ‘There is no god but God,’ ” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Whilst reciting the above, stand upright, close to the patient’s head, grasping a
spear in your left hand. Brandish this spear over the body of the patient, drawing
a long breath.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20624src" href="#xd32e20624">136</a>
</p>
<p>This spear must afterwards be ransomed, (say) for forty cents; in default of which
payment it is forfeited to the medicine-man.
</p>
<p>The directions for another form of the ceremony just described (“casting out the mischief”),
are as follows:—
</p>
<p>Whenever a person is suffering from the influence of a waxen image (such as is described
elsewhere),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20657src" href="#xd32e20657">137</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb431">[<a href="#pb431">431</a>]</span>you must rub him (or her) all over with limes in order to “cast out the mischief.”
These limes must be of seven different kinds, and you will require three of each kind.
When you have got them, fumigate them with incense and repeat the appropriate charm,
which is practically an appeal addressed to the spirit of the limes to assist in extracting
the poisonous principle from the body of the sick man:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, O Lelang,
</p>
<p class="line">We have been brothers from the former time until now,
</p>
<p class="line">I am fain to order you to assist me in extracting everything that is poisonous
</p>
<p class="line">From the body and limbs of <i>So-and-So</i>.
</p>
<p class="line">Break not your solemn promise,
</p>
<p class="line">Break not your plighted faith,
</p>
<p class="line">And use not deceit or wiles,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Of course the luckless spirit is told that if he does not do exactly as he is bidden
he must expect the curse to follow.
</p>
<p>This charm must be repeated overnight, and early next morning three thicknesses of
<i lang="ms">birah</i> leaves must be laid down (for the patient to stand upon during the lustration). The
seven sorts of limes are at the same time to be squeezed into a bowl and divided into
three portions. These portions are to be used three times during the day, at sunrise,
noon, and sundown respectively, partly for washing off the cosmetics (which are rubbed
all over the body), and partly as a medicinal draught or potion.
</p>
<p>In the morning the cosmetic must be white (<i lang="ms">bĕdak puteh lulut</i>), at noon it must be red (<i lang="ms">bĕdak merah</i>), and at sundown black (<i lang="ms">bĕdak hitam</i>). The “trash” of the limes (after squeezing) is wrapped up in a <i lang="ms">birah</i> leaf at evening, and either carried out to the sea (into which it is dropped), or
deposited ashore at a safe <span class="pageNum" id="pb432">[<a href="#pb432">432</a>]</span>distance from the house. The only special taboo mentioned for this ceremony is that
the patient must not during its continuance meet anybody who has come from a distance.
</p>
<p>Another very curious form of this ceremony of “casting out devils” was described to
me by a Kelantan Malay. It is worked on the substitute or “scapegoat” principle (<i lang="ms">tukar ganti</i>), and the idea is to make little dough images of all kinds of birds, beasts, fishes,
and even inanimate objects (a few of the former being fowls, ducks, horses, apes,
buffaloes, bullocks, wild cattle (<i lang="ms">sĕladang</i>), deer, mouse-deer, and elephants, besides those enumerated in the charm itself,
whilst exceptions are to be the “unlucky” animals (<i lang="ms">bĕnatang sial</i>) such as cats, tigers, pigs, dogs, snakes, and iguanas). When made they are to be
deposited together in a heap upon a sacrificial tray (<i lang="ms">anchak</i>), together with betel-leaves, cigarettes, and tapers. One of the tapers is made to
stand upon a silver dollar, with the end of a piece of particoloured thread inserted
between the dollar and the foot of the taper; and the other end of this thread is
given to the patient to hold whilst the necessary charm is being repeated.
</p>
<p>Part of this charm is worth quoting, as it helps to explain the line of thought on
which the medicine-man is working:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“I have made a substitute for you,
</p>
<p class="line">And engage you for hire.
<hr class="tb">
</p>
<p class="line">As for your wish to eat, I give you food,
</p>
<p class="line">As for your wish to drink, I give you drink.
</p>
<p class="line">Lo, I give you good measure whether of sharks,
</p>
<p class="line">Skates, lobsters, crabs, shell-fish (both of land and sea)—
</p>
<p class="line">Every kind of substitute I give you,
</p>
<p class="line">Good measure whether of flesh or of blood, both cooked and raw.
</p>
<p class="line">Accept, accept duly this banquet of mine.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb433">[<a href="#pb433">433</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">It was good at the first: if it is not good now,
</p>
<p class="line">It is not I who give it.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The explanation of this part of the ceremony is that the evil spirit, or “mischief,”
is supposed to leave the body of the sick man, and to proceed (guided, of course,
by the many-coloured thread which the patient holds in his hand) to enter into the
choice collection of “scapegoats” lying in the tray. As soon as his devilship is got
fairly into the tray, the medicine-man looses three slip-knots (<i lang="ms">lĕpas-lĕpas</i>), and repeats a charm to induce the evil spirit to go, and throws away the untied
knots outside the house.
</p>
<p>The original “disease-boat” used in Selangor was a model of a special kind of Malay
vessel called <i lang="ms">lanchang</i>. This <i lang="ms">lanchang</i> was a two-masted vessel with galleries (<i lang="ms">dandan</i>) fore and aft, armed with cannon, and used by Malay Rajas on the Sumatran coast.
This latter fact was, no doubt, one reason for its being selected as the type of boat
most likely to prove acceptable to the spirits. To make it still further acceptable,
however, the model was not unfrequently stained with turmeric or saffron, yellow being
recognised as the royal colour among the Malays.
</p>
<p>Occasionally, on the other hand, a mere raft (<i lang="ms">rakit</i>) is set adrift, sometimes a small model of the <i lang="ms">balei</i> (state-chamber), and sometimes only a set of the banana-leaf receptacles called <i lang="ms">limas</i>.
</p>
<p>The vessel in the case of an important person is occasionally of great size and excellent
finish—indeed, local tradition has it that an exceptionally large and perfect specimen
(which was launched upon the Klang river in Selangor some years ago, on the occasion
of an illness of the Tungku ’Chik, eldest daughter of the late Sultan), was actually
towed down to sea by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb434">[<a href="#pb434">434</a>]</span>Government steam launch <i lang="ms">ʿAbdul Samad</i>. When all is ready the <i lang="ms">lanchang</i> is loaded with offerings, which are of an exactly similar character to those which
are deposited on the sacrificial tray or <i lang="ms">anchak</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20770src" href="#xd32e20770">138</a> already described. Then one end of a piece of yellow thread is fastened to the patient’s
wrist (the other end being presumably made fast to the spirit-boat, or <i lang="ms">lanchang</i>); incense is burnt and a charm recited, the purport of it being to persuade the evil
spirits which have taken possession of the patient to enter on board the vessel. This,
when they are thought to have done so, is then<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20803src" href="#xd32e20803">139</a> taken down to the sea or river and set adrift, invariably at the ebb tide, which
is supposed to carry the boat (and the spirits with it) “to another country.” One
of the charms used at this stage of the ceremony even mentions the name of the country
to which the devils are to be carried, the place singled out for this distinction
being the Island of Celebes! The passage in question runs as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be unto you, Devils of the sea, and Demons of the sea,
</p>
<p class="line">Neither on cape, nor bay, nor sandbank be ye stuck or stranded!
</p>
<p class="line">This vessel (<i lang="ms">lanchang</i>) is that of Arong,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20820src" href="#xd32e20820">140</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb435">[<a href="#pb435">435</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Do you assist in guarding this offering from his grandchildren,
</p>
<p class="line">And vex not this vessel.
</p>
<p class="line">I request you to escort it to the land of Celebes,
</p>
<p class="line">To its own place.
</p>
<p class="line">By the grace of,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This same charm is used <i lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i> for the Balei (Spirit-hall).
</p>
<p>A common form of the “Lanchang” charm runs as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ho, elders of the upper reaches,
</p>
<p class="line">Elders of the lower reaches,
</p>
<p class="line">Elders of the dry land,
</p>
<p class="line">Elders of the river-flats,
</p>
<p class="line">Assemble ye, O people, Lords of hill and hill-foot,
</p>
<p class="line">Lords of cavern and hill-locked basin,
</p>
<p class="line">Lords of the deep primeval forest,

<p class="line">Lords of the river-bends,
</p>
<p class="line">Come on board this Lanchang, assembling in your multitudes,
</p>
<p class="line">So may ye depart with the ebbing stream,
</p>
<p class="line">Depart on the passing breeze,
</p>
<p class="line">Depart in the yawning earth,
</p>
<p class="line">Depart in the red-dyed earth.
</p>
<p class="line">Go ye to the ocean which has no wave,
</p>
<p class="line">And the plain where no green herb grows,

<p class="line">Ye shall be consumed by the curse.

<p class="line">At sea ye shall get no drink,

<p class="line">Ashore ye shall get no food,
</p>
<p class="line">But gape (in vain) about the world.
</p>
<p class="line">By the grace of,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Sometimes the crocodile-spirit is requested to act as the forwarding agent in the
transaction; thus we find a short <i lang="ms">lanchang</i>-charm running as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ho, Elder of the Sloping Bank, Jambu Agai,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20872src" href="#xd32e20872">141</a>

<p class="line">Receive this (<i lang="ms">lanchang</i>) and forward it to the River-Bay,
</p>
<p class="line">It is <i>So-and-So</i> who presents it.
</p>
<p class="line">Sa-rĕkong is the name of the (spirit of the) Bay,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb436">[<a href="#pb436">436</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Sa-rĕking the name of the (spirit of the) Cape,
</p>
<p class="line">Si ʿAbas, their child, is the rocky islet;
</p>
<p class="line">I ask (you) to forward this present at once to the God of Mid-currents.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A somewhat longer charm, which is given in the Appendix, commences by making an interesting
point—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you! O crew newly come from your shipwrecked barque on the high seas,
</p>
<p class="line">Spurned by the billows, blown about by the gale;

</p>
<p class="line">. . . . . . . . .</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The speaker goes on to say that he recognises their right to levy toll all over the
country, and has made this <i lang="ms">lanchang</i> for them as a substitute (<i lang="ms">tukar ganti</i>), implying, no doubt, in place of the one which they had lost. In any case, however,
there can be little doubt that the “barque wrecked on the high seas” is the wasted
body of the sick man, of which the spirits were so recently in possession, and in
substitution for which they are offered the spirit-boat in question.

<h4 class="main"><i>Tiger Spirit</i></h4>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I shall now proceed to describe the ceremony of invoking the Tiger Spirit for the
purpose of obtaining his assistance in expelling a rival spirit of less power.
</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1896 (in the Kuala Langat District of Selangor) the brother of my
Malay collector ʿUmar happening to fall ill of some slight ailment, I asked and obtained
permission to be present at the ceremony of doctoring the patient. The time fixed
for the commencement of the ceremony (which is usually repeated for three consecutive
nights) was seven o’clock on the following evening. On reaching the <span class="pageNum" id="pb437">[<a href="#pb437">437</a>]</span>house at the time appointed I was met by ʿUmar, and ascending the house-ladder, was
invited to seat myself upon a mat about two yards from the spot where the medicine-man
was expected to take up his position. Having done so, and looking round, I found that
there were in all nine persons present (including myself, but exclusive of the Pawang,
his wife, or the patient), and I was informed that although it is not necessary for
the same persons to be present on each of the three nights, the greatest care must
be taken to see that the number of persons present, which should never, in strictness,
be an even number, does not vary from night to night, because to allow any such variation
would be to court disaster. Hence I myself was only enabled to be present as a substitute
for one of the sick man’s relatives who had been there on the preceding night.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20922src" href="#xd32e20922">142</a>
</p>
<div class="figure fig2width" id="fig2"><img src="images/fig02.png" alt="Fig. 2.—Ceremony of invoking the tiger spirit." width="433" height="463"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Fig. 2.</span>—Ceremony of invoking the tiger spirit.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>The accompanying diagram shows (approximately) the relative positions of all who were
present. In one corner of the room was the patient’s bed (sleeping-mat) and mosquito
curtain with a patchwork front, and in a line parallel to the bed stood the three
jars of water, each decorated with the sort of fringe or collar of plaited cocoa-nut
fronds called “centipedes’ feet” (<i lang="ms">jari ’lipan</i>), and each, too, furnished with a fresh yam-leaf covering to its mouth. A little
nearer to me than the three water-jars, but in the same line, stood a fairly big jar
similarly decorated, but filled with a big bouquet of artificial “flowers” and ornaments
<span class="pageNum" id="pb438">[<a href="#pb438">438</a>]</span>instead of the water. These flowers were skilfully manufactured from plaited strips
of palm-leaf, and in addition to mere “flowers” represented such objects as rings,
cocoa-nuts, centipedes, doves, and the like, all of which were made of the plaited
fronds referred to. This invention was intended (I was informed) to represent a pleasure-garden
(<i lang="ms">taman bunga</i>), and indeed was so called; it was (I believe) intended to attract the spirit whom
it was the object of the ceremony to invoke. In front of the three jars stood, as
a matter of course, a censer filled with burning embers, and a box containing the
usual accessories for the chewing of betel. Everything being now ready, the medicine-man
appeared and took his seat beside the censer, his wife, an aged <span class="pageNum" id="pb439">[<a href="#pb439">439</a>]</span>woman, whose office was to chant the invocation, to her own accompaniment, taking
her seat at the same time near the head of the patient’s sleeping-mat. Presently she
struck up the invocation (<i lang="ms">lagu pĕmanggil</i>), and we listened in rapt attention as the voice, at first weak and feeble with age,
gathered strength and wailed ever higher and shriller up to the climax at the end
of the chant. At the time it was hard to distinguish the words, but I learnt from
her afterwards that this was what she sang:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">A number of rhymed stanzas follow which will be found in the Appendix.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the medicine-man was not backward in his preparations for the proper reception
of the spirit. First he scattered incense on the embers and fumigated himself therewith,
“shampooing” himself, so to speak, with his hands, and literally bathing in the cloud
of incense which volumed up from the newly-replenished censer and hung like a dense
gray mist over his head. Next he inhaled the incense through his nostrils, and announced
in the accents of what is called the spirit-language (<i lang="ms">bhasa hantu</i>) that he was going to “lie down.” This he accordingly did, reclining upon his back,
and drawing the upper end of his long plaid <i lang="ms">sarong</i> over his head so as to completely conceal his features. The invocation was not yet
ended, and for some time we sat in the silence of expectation. At length, however,
the moment of possession arrived, and with a violent convulsive movement, which was
startling in its suddenness, the “Pawang” rolled over on to his face. Again a brief
interval ensued, and a second but somewhat less violent spasm shook his frame, the
spasm being strangely followed by a dry and ghostly cough. A moment later and the
Pawang, still with shrouded head, was seated bolt upright facing the tambourine player.
Then he fronted round, still in a sitting posture, until he faced the jars, and removed
the yam-leaf covering from the mouth of each jar in turn.
</p>
<p>Next he kindled a wax taper at the flame of a lamp placed for the purpose just behind
the jars, and planted it firmly on the brim of the first jar by spilling a little
wax upon the spot where it was to stand. Two <span class="pageNum" id="pb441">[<a href="#pb441">441</a>]</span>similar tapers having been kindled and planted upon the brims of the second and third
jars, he then partook of a “chew” of betel-leaf (which was presented to him by one
of the women present), crooning the while to himself.
</p>
<p>This refreshment concluded, he drew from his girdle a bezoar or talismanic stone (<i lang="ms">batu pĕnawar</i>), and proceeded to rub it all over the patient’s neck and shoulders. Then, facing
about, he put on a new white jacket and head-cloth which had been placed beside him
for his use, and girding his plaid (<i lang="ms">sarong</i>) about his waist, drew from its sheath a richly-wrought dagger (<i lang="ms">k’ris</i>) which he fumigated in the smoke of the censer and returned to its scabbard.
</p>
<p>He next took three silver 20-cent pieces of “Straits” coinage, to serve as <i lang="ms">batu buyong</i>, or “jar-stones,” and after “charming” them dropped each of the three in turn into
one of the water-jars, and “inspected” them intently as they lay at the bottom of
the water, shading, at the same time, his eyes with his hand from the light of the
tapers. He now charmed several handfuls of rice (“parched,” “washed,” and “saffron”
rice), and after a further inspection declared, in shrill, unearthly accents, that
each of the coins was lying exactly under its own respective taper, and that therefore
his “child” (the sick man) was very dangerously ill, though he might yet possibly
recover with the aid of the spirit. Next, scattering the rice round the row of jars
(the track of the rice thus forming an ellipse), he broke off several small blossom-stalks
from a sheaf of areca-palm blossom, and making them up with sprays of <i lang="ms">champaka</i> into three separate bouquets, placed one of these improvised nosegays in each of
the three jars of water. On the floor at the back of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb442">[<a href="#pb442">442</a>]</span>row of jars he next deposited a piece of white cloth, five cubits in length, which
he had just previously fumigated. Again drawing the dagger already referred to, the
Pawang now successively plunged it up to the hilt into each of the three bouquets
(in which hostile spirits might, I was told, possibly be lurking). Then seizing an
unopened blossom-spathe of the areca-palm, he anointed the latter all over with “oil
of Celebes,” extracted the sheaf of palm-blossom from its casing, fumigated it, and
laid it gently across the patient’s breast. Rapidly working himself up into a state
of intense excitement, and with gestures of the utmost vehemence, he now proceeded
to “stroke” the patient with the sheaf of blossom rapidly downwards, in the direction
of the feet, on reaching which he beat out the blossom against the floor. Then turning
the patient over on to his face, and repeating the stroking process, he again beat
out the blossom, and then sank back exhausted upon the floor, where he lay face downwards,
with his head once more enveloped in the folds of the <i lang="ms">sarong</i>.
</p>
<p>A long interval now ensued, but at length, after many convulsive twitchings, the shrouded
figure arose, amid the intense excitement of the entire company, and went upon its
hands and feet. The Tiger Spirit had taken possession of the Pawang’s body, and presently
a low, but startlingly life-like growl—the unmistakable growl of the dreaded “Lord
of the Forest”—seemed to issue from somewhere under our feet, as the weird shrouded
figure began scratching furiously at the mat upon which it had been quietly lying,
and then, with occasional pauses for the emission of the growls, which had previously
startled us, and the performance of wonderful cat-like leaps, rapidly licked <span class="pageNum" id="pb443">[<a href="#pb443">443</a>]</span>up the handfuls of rice which had been thrown upon the floor in front of it. This
part of the performance lasted, however, but a few minutes, and then the evident excitement
of the onlookers was raised to fever pitch, as the bizarre, and, as it seemed to our
fascinated senses, strangely brute-like form stooped suddenly forward, and slowly
licked over, as a tigress would lick its cub, the all but naked body of the patient—a
performance (to a European) of so powerfully nauseating a character that it can hardly
be conceived that any human being could persist in it unless he was more or less unconscious
of his actions. At all events, after his complete return to consciousness at the conclusion
of the ceremony, even the Pawang experienced a severe attack of nausea, such as might
well be supposed to be the result of his performance. Meanwhile, however, the ceremony
continued. Reverting to a sitting posture (though still with shrouded head), the Pawang
now leaned forward over the patient, and with the point of his dagger drew blood from
his own arm; then rising to his feet he engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand combat with
his invisible foe (the spirit whom he had been summoned to exorcise). At first his
weapon was the dagger, but before long he discarded this, and laid about him stoutly
enough with the sheaf of areca-palm blossom.
</p>
<p>Presently, however, he quieted down somewhat, and commenced to “stroke” the sick man
(as before) with the sheaf of palm-blossom, beating out the blossom upon the floor
as usual at the end of the operation. Then sitting down again and crooning to himself,
he partook of betel-leaf, faced round towards the patient and stooped over him, muttering
as he did so, and passing his hands all over the prostrate form. <span class="pageNum" id="pb444">[<a href="#pb444">444</a>]</span>Next he turned once more to the jars and again plunged his dagger into each of them
in turn (to make sure that the evil spirit was not lurking in them), and then drawing
his head-cloth over his head so as to completely hide his face, he once more took
his seat beside the patient, stooping over him from time to time and crooning charms
as he did so.
</p>
<p>Finally he clapped his hands, removed his head-cloth, “stroked” the patient over and
flicked him with the corners of it, and then shrouding himself once more in the <i lang="ms">sarong</i>, lay down at full length in a state of complete exhaustion. A pause of about ten
minutes’ duration now followed, and then with sundry convulsive twitchings the Pawang
returned to consciousness and sat up, and the ceremony was over.
</p>
<p>The following description of a ceremony similar to the one just described is taken
from <i>Malay Sketches</i>:—
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">bĕr-hantu</i> is, of course, a survival of præ-Islam darkness, and the priests abominate it, or
say they do; but they have to be a little careful, because the highest society affects
the practice of the Black Art.
</p>
<p>“To return to the king’s house. In the middle of the floor was spread a <i lang="ms">puâdal</i>, a small narrow mat, at one end of which was seated a middle-aged woman dressed like
a man in a short-sleeved jacket, trousers, a <i lang="ms">sârong</i>, and a scarf fastened tightly round her waist. At the other end of the mat was a
large newly-lighted candle in a candlestick. Between the woman and the taper were
two or three small vessels containing rice coloured with turmeric, parched <i lang="ms">padi</i>, and perfumed water. An attendant sat near at hand.
</p>
<p>“The woman in male attire was the <i lang="ms">Pâwang</i>, the Raiser of Spirits, the Witch, not of Endor, but of as <span class="pageNum" id="pb445">[<a href="#pb445">445</a>]</span>great repute in her own country and among her own people. In ordinary life she was
an amusing lady named Raja Ngah, a scion of the reigning house on the female side,
and a member of a family skilled in all matters pertaining to occultism. In a corner
of the room were five or six girls holding native drums, instruments with a skin stretched
over one side only, and this is beaten usually with the fingers. The leader of this
orchestra was the daughter of Raja Ngah.
</p>
<p>“Shortly after I sat down, the proceedings began by the <i lang="ms">Pâwang</i> covering her head and face with a silken cloth, while the orchestra began to sing
a weird melody in an unknown tongue. I was told it was the spirit language; the air
was one specially pleasing to a particular <i lang="ms">Jin</i>, or Spirit, and the invocation, after reciting his praises, besought him to come
from the mountains or the sea, from underground or overhead, and relieve the torments
of the King.
</p>
<p>“As the song continued, accompanied by the rhythmical beating of the drums, the <i lang="ms">Pâwang</i> sat with shrouded head in front of the lighted taper, holding in her right hand against
her left breast a small sheaf of the grass called <i lang="ms">daun sambau</i>, tied tightly together and cut square at top and bottom.
</p>
<p>“This <i lang="ms">châdak</i> she shook, together with her whole body, by a stiffening of the muscles, while all
eyes were fixed upon the taper.
</p>
<p>“At first the flame was steady, but by and by, as the singers screamed more loudly
to attract the attention of the laggard Spirit, the wick began to quiver and flare
up, and it was manifest to the initiated that the <i lang="ms">Jin</i> was introducing himself into the candle. By some means the <i lang="ms">Pâwang</i>, who was now supposed to <span class="pageNum" id="pb446">[<a href="#pb446">446</a>]</span>be ‘possessed’ and no longer conscious of her actions, became aware of this, and she
made obeisance to the taper, sprinkling the floor round it with saffron-coloured rice
and perfumed water; then, rising to her feet and followed by the attendant, she performed
the same ceremony before each male member of the reigning family present in the room,
murmuring all the while a string of gibberish addressed to the Spirit. This done,
she resumed her seat on the mat, and, after a brief pause, the minstrels struck up
a different air, and, singing the praises of another <i lang="ms">Jin</i>, called upon him to come and relieve the King’s distress.
</p>
<p>“I ascertained that each Malay State has its own special Spirits, each district is
equally well provided, and there are even some to spare for special individuals<span class="corr" id="xd32e21107" title="Source: ,">.</span> In this particular State there are four principal <i lang="ms">Jin</i>; they are the <i lang="ms">Jin ka-râja-an</i>, the State Spirit—also called <i lang="ms">Junjong dŭnia udâra</i>, Supporter of the Firmament; <i lang="ms">Mâia udâra</i>, the Spirit of the Air; <i lang="ms">Mahkôta si-râja Jin</i>, the Crown of Royal Spirits; and <i lang="ms">S’tan Ali</i>.
</p>
<p>“These four are known as <i lang="ms">Jin âruah</i>, Exalted Spirits, and they are the guardians of the Sultan and the State. As one
star exceeds another in glory, so one <i lang="ms">Jin</i> surpasses another in renown, and I have named them in the order of their greatness.
In their honour four white and crimson umbrellas were hung in the room, presumably
for their use when they arrived from their distant homes. Only the Sultan of the State
is entitled to traffic with these distinguished Spirits; when summoned they decline
to move unless appealed to with their own special invocations, set to their own peculiar
music, sung by at least four singers, and led by a <i lang="ms">Bĕduan</i> (singer) of the royal family. The <i lang="ms">Jin <span class="pageNum" id="pb447">[<a href="#pb447">447</a>]</span>ka-râja-an</i> is entitled to have the royal drums played by the State drummers if his presence
is required, but the other three have to be satisfied with the instruments I have
described.
</p>
<p>“There are common devils who look after common people; such as <i lang="ms">Hantu Songkei</i>, <i lang="ms">Hantu Malâyu</i>, and <i lang="ms">Hantu Blîan</i>; the last the ‘Tiger Devil,’ but out of politeness he is called ‘Blîan,’ to save
his feelings.
</p>
<p>“Then there is <i lang="ms">Kĕmâla ajaib</i>, the ‘Wonderful Jewel,’ <i lang="ms">Israng</i>, Raja Ngah’s special familiar, and a host of others. Most <i lang="ms">hantu</i> have their own special <i lang="ms">Pâwangs</i>, and several of these were carrying on similar proceedings in adjoining buildings,
in order that the sick monarch might reap all the benefits to be derived from a consultation
of experts, and as one spirit after another notified his advent by the upstarting
flame of the taper, it was impossible not to feel that one was getting into the very
best society.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure fig3width" id="fig3"><img src="images/fig03.png" alt="Fig. 3.—Sixteen-sided stand used at the invocation of spirits." width="155" height="151"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Fig. 3.</span>—Sixteen-sided stand used at the invocation of spirits.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Meanwhile a sixteen-sided stand, about six inches high and shaped like this diagram,
had been placed on the floor near the <i>Pâwang’s</i> mat. The stand was decorated with yellow cloth; in its centre stood an enormous candle,
while round it were gaily-decorated rice and toothsome delicacies specially prized
by <i lang="ms">Jin</i>. There was just room to sit on this stand, which is called <i lang="ms">Pĕtrâna panchalôgam</i> (meaning a seat of this particular shape), and the Sultan, supported by many attendants,
was brought out and sat upon it. A veil was placed on his head, the various vessels
were put in his hands, he spread the rice round the taper, <span class="pageNum" id="pb448">[<a href="#pb448">448</a>]</span>sprinkled the perfume, and having received into his hand an enormous <i lang="ms">châdak</i> of grass, calmly awaited the coming of the <i lang="ms">Jin Ka-râja-an</i>, while the minstrels shouted for him with all their might.
</p>
<p>“The Sultan sat there for some time, occasionally giving a convulsive shudder, and
when this taper had duly flared up, and all the rites had been performed, His Highness
was conducted back again to his couch, and the <i lang="ms">Pâwang</i> continued her ministrations alone.
</p>
<p>“Whilst striding across the floor she suddenly fell down as though shot, and it was
explained to me that <i lang="ms">Israng</i>, the spirit by whom she was possessed, had seen a dish-cover, and that the sight
always frightened him to such an extent that his <i lang="ms">Pâwang</i> fell down. The cause of offence was removed, and the performance continued.
</p>
<p>“There are other spirits who cannot bear the barking of a dog, the mewing of a cat,
and so on.
</p>
<p>“Just before dawn there was a sudden confusion within the curtains which hid the Sultan’s
couch; they were thrown aside, and there lay the King, to all appearance in a swoon.
The <i lang="ms">Jin Ka-râja-an</i> had taken possession of the sick body, and the mind was no longer under its owner’s
control.
</p>
<p>“For a little while there was great excitement, and then the King recovered consciousness,
was carried to a side verandah, and a quantity of cold water poured over him.
</p>
<p>“So ended the <i>séance</i>.
</p>
<p>“Shortly after, the Sultan, clothed and in his right mind, sent to say he would like
to speak to me. He told me he took part in this ceremony to please his people, and
because it was a very old custom, and he <span class="pageNum" id="pb449">[<a href="#pb449">449</a>]</span>added, ‘I did not know you were there till just now; I could not see you because I
was not myself and did not know what I was doing.’
</p>
<p>“The King did not die, after all—on the contrary, I was sent for twice again because
he was not expected to live till the morning, and yet he cheated Death—for a time.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21227src" href="#xd32e21227">143</a>
</p>
<p>The ceremony called <i lang="ms">Mĕngalin</i>, or the “sucking charm” ceremony, is one which is very curious, and deserves to be
described in some detail.
</p>
<p>First of all you perform the ceremony called “Driving out the Mischief” (<i lang="ms">buang badi</i>) from the sick man (<i>vide supra</i>) in or to drive away all evil spirits (<i lang="ms">mĕnolak sakalian chĕkĕdi atau hantu</i>). Then wrap the patient up in a white or black cloth, and taking a ball of (kneaded)
dough (<i lang="ms">tĕpong pĕngalin</i>), eggs and saffron, repeat the suitable charm, and roll it all over the skin of the
patient’s body in order to draw out all poisonous influences (<i lang="ms">mĕnchabut sagala bisa-bisa</i>). Then if you find inside the ball of dough after opening it an infinitesimally small
splinter of bone, or a few red hairs, you will know that these belong to the evil
spirit who has been plaguing the patient. The charm to be used when rolling the ball
of dough over the skin runs as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be unto you, O Shadowy Venom!
</p>
<p class="line">Venom be at ease no longer!
</p>
<p class="line">Venom find shelter no longer!
</p>
<p class="line">Venom take your ease no longer!
</p>
<p class="line">May you be blown upon, O Venom, by the passing breeze!
</p>
<p class="line">May you be blown upon, O Venom, by the yellow sunset-glow,
</p>
<p class="line">May the Pounce of this Lanthorn’s lightning kill you;
</p>
<p class="line">May the Pounce of this Twilight’s lanthorn kill you,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb450">[<a href="#pb450">450</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">May the Shaft of the Thunderbolt kill you;
</p>
<p class="line">May the Fall of the heavy Rains kill you,
</p>
<p class="line">May the Inundation of Flood-waters kill you;
</p>
<p class="line">May you be towed till you are swamped by this my head-cloth,
</p>
<p class="line">May you be drowned in the swell of this my dough-boat.
</p>
<p class="line">By the grace of,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A second charm of great length follows, the object of which is to drive out the evil
spirit in possession of the man.
</p>
<p>An example of this form of cure as practised by Malay medicine-men is referred to
by Mr. Clifford, who, in speaking of his punkah-puller, Umat, says:—
</p>
<p>“It was soon after his marriage that his trouble fell upon Umat, and swept much of
the sunshine from his life. He contracted a form of ophthalmia, and for a time was
blind. Native Medicine Men doctored him, and drew sheaves of needles and bunches of
thorns from his eyes, which they declared were the cause of his affliction. These
miscellaneous odds and ends used to be brought to me at breakfast-time, floating,
most unappetisingly, in a shallow cup half-full of water; and Umat went abroad with
eye-sockets stained crimson, or black, according to the fancy of the native physician.
The aid of an English doctor was called in, but Umat was too thoroughly a Malay to
trust the more simple remedies prescribed to him, and though his blindness was relieved,
and he became able to walk without the aid of a staff, his eyesight could never really
be given back to him.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21279src" href="#xd32e21279">144</a>
</p>
<p>In the above connection I may remark that, whether from the working of their own imaginations
or otherwise, those who were believed to be possessed by demons certainly suffered,
and that severely. H.H. Raja Kahar, the son of H.H. the late Sultan of <span class="pageNum" id="pb451">[<a href="#pb451">451</a>]</span>Selangor, was attacked by a familiar demon during my residence in the Langat District,
and shortly afterwards commenced to pine away. He declared that the offending demon
was sitting in his skull, at the back of his head, and that it dragged up and devoured
everything that he swallowed. Hence he refused at length to eat any sort of solid
food, and gradually wasted away until he became a mere skeleton, and went about imploring
people to take a hatchet and split his skull open, in order to extract the demon which
he believed it to contain. Gradually his strength failed, and at length I learned
from H.H. the Sultan (then Raja Muda) that all the Malays in the neighbourhood had
assembled to wail at his decease. As we strolled among the cocoa-nut palms and talked,
I told him of the many miraculous cures which had attended cases of faith-healing
in England, and suggested, not of course expecting to be taken seriously, that he
should try the effect of such a cure upon his uncle, and “make believe” to extract
some “mantises” from the back of his head. To my intense astonishment some days later,
I learned that this idea had been carried out during my temporary absence from the
district, and that the Muhammadan priest, after cupping him severely, had shown him
seven large mantises which he pretended to have extracted from the back of his head.
The experiment proved extraordinarily successful, and Raja Kahar recovered at all
events for the time. He declared, however, that there were more of these mantises
left, and eventually suffered a relapse and died during my absence in England on leave.
For the time, however, the improvement was quite remarkable, and when Said Mashahor,
the Pĕnghulu of Kerling, visited him a few days later, Raja <span class="pageNum" id="pb452">[<a href="#pb452">452</a>]</span>Kahar, after an account of the cure from his own point of view, declared that nobody
would now believe that he had been so ill, although “no fewer than seven large mantises”
had been “extracted from his head.”
</p>
<p>I now give a specimen of the ceremonies used for recalling a wandering soul by means
of a dough figure or image (<i lang="ms">gambar tĕpong</i>). It is not stated whether any of the usual accessories of these figures (hair and
nails, etc.) are mixed with the dough, but an old and famous soul-doctor (’Che Amal,
of Jugra) told me that the dough figure should be made, in strictness, from the ball
of kneaded dough which is rolled all over the patient’s body by the medicine-man during
the “sucking-charm” ceremony (<i lang="ms">mĕngalin</i>). The directions for making it run as follows:—
</p>
<p>Make an image of dough, in length about nine inches, and representing the opposite
sex to that of the patient. Deposit it (on its back) upon five cubits of white cloth,
which must be folded up small for the purpose, and then plant a miniature green umbrella
(made of cloth coated thickly with wax, and standing from four to five inches in height)
at the head of the image, and a small green clove-shaped taper (of about the same
height) at its feet. Then burn incense; take three handfuls each of “parched,” “washed,”
and “saffron” rice, and scatter them thrice round the figure, saying as you do so:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“O Flying Paper,
</p>
<p class="line">Come and fly into this cup.
</p>
<p class="line">Pass by me like a shadow,
</p>
<p class="line">I am applying the charm called the ‘Drunken Stars<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21305src" href="#xd32e21305">145</a><span class="corr" id="xd32e21310" title="Not in source">’</span>
</p>
<p class="line">Drunken stars are on my left,
</p>
<p class="line">A full moon (lit. 14th day moon) is on my right,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb453">[<a href="#pb453">453</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">And the Umbrella of Si Lanchang is opposite to me
</p>
<p class="line">Grant this by virtue of ‘There is no god but God,’ ” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The statement that this dough image should represent the opposite sex to that of the
patient should be received with caution, and requires further investigation to clear
it up. My informant explained that the “Flying Paper” (<i lang="ms">krĕtas layang-layang</i>) referred to the soul-cloth, and the “cup” to the image, but if this explanation
is accepted, it is yet not unlikely that a real cup was used in the original charm.
The “drunken stars” he explained as referring to the parched rice scattered on his
left, and the full moon to the eyes of the image. Arguing from the analogy of other
ceremonies conducted on the same lines, the wandering soul would be recalled and induced
to enter the so-called cup (<i>i.e.</i> the dough image), and being transferred thence to the soul-cloth underneath it, would
be passed on to the patient in the soul-cloth itself.
</p>
<p>Another way to recall a soul (which was taught me by ’Che ʿAbas of Kelantan) is to
take seven betel-leaves with meeting leaf-ribs (<i lang="ms">sirih bĕrtĕmu urat</i>), and make them up into seven “chews” of betel. Then take a plateful of saffron-rice,
parched rice, and washed rice, and seven pieces of parti-coloured thread (<i lang="ms">bĕnang pancharona tujoh urat</i>) and an egg; deposit these at the feet of the sick man, giving him one end of the
thread to hold, and fastening the other end to the egg.
</p>
<p>The soul is then called upon to return to the house which it has deserted, is caught
in a soul-cloth, and passed (it is thought) first of all into the egg, and thence
back into the patient’s body by means of the thread which connects the egg with the
patient. The charm runs as follows:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb454">[<a href="#pb454">454</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, O Breath!
</p>
<p class="line">Hither, Breath, come hither!
</p>
<p class="line">Hither, Soul, come hither!
</p>
<p class="line">Hither, Little One, come hither!
</p>
<p class="line">Hither, Filmy One, come hither!
</p>
<p class="line">Hither, I am sitting and praising you!
</p>
<p class="line">Hither, I am sitting and waving to you!
</p>
<p class="line">Come back to your house and house-ladder,
</p>
<p class="line">To your floor of which the planks have started,
</p>
<p class="line">To your thatch-roof ‘starred’ (with holes).
</p>
<p class="line">Do not bear grudges,
</p>
<p class="line">Do not bear malice,
</p>
<p class="line">Do not take it as a wrong,
</p>
<p class="line">Do not take it as a transgression.
</p>
<p class="line">Here I sit and praise you.
</p>
<p class="line">Here I sit and drag you (home),
</p>
<p class="line">Here I sit and shout for you,
</p>
<p class="line">Here I sit and wave to you,
</p>
<p class="line">Come at this very time, come at this very moment,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Another way of recalling the soul is as follows:—
</p>
<p>Put some husked rice in a rice-bag (<i lang="ms">sumpit</i>) with an egg, a nail, and a candle-nut; scatter it (<i lang="ms">kirei</i>) thrice round the patient’s head, and deposit the bag behind his pillow (<i lang="ms">di kapala tidor</i>), after repeating this charm:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Cluck, cluck, souls of <i>So-and-so</i>, all seven of you,
</p>
<p class="line">Return ye unto your own house and house-ladder!
</p>
<p class="line">Here are your parents come to summon you back,
</p>
<p class="line">Back to your own house and house-ladder, your own clearing and yard,
</p>
<p class="line">To the presence of your own parents, of your own family and relations,
</p>
<p class="line">Go not to and fro,
</p>
<p class="line">But return to your own home.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When three days have expired, gather up the rice again and put it all back into the
bag. If there is a grain over throw it to the fowls, but if the measure falls short
repeat the ceremony.
</p>
<p>Again, in order to recall an escaping soul (<i lang="ms">riang <span class="pageNum" id="pb455">[<a href="#pb455">455</a>]</span>sĕmangat</i>) the soul-doctor will take a fowl’s egg, seven small cockle-shells (<i lang="ms">kulit k’rang tujoh kĕping</i>), and a <i lang="ms">kal</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21394src" href="#xd32e21394">146</a> of husked rice, and put them all together into a rice-bag (<i lang="ms">sumpit</i>). He then rubs the bag all over the skin of the patient’s body, shakes the contents
well up together, and deposits it again close to the patient’s head. Whilst shaking
them up he repeats the following charm:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Cluck! cluck! soul of this sick man, <i>So-and-so</i>,
</p>
<p class="line">Return into the frame and body of <i>So-and-so</i>,
</p>
<p class="line">To your own house and house-ladder, to your own ground and yard,
</p>
<p class="line">To your own parents, to your own sheath.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">At the end of three days he measures the rice; if the amount has increased, it signifies
that the soul has returned; if it is the same as before, it is still half out of the
body; if less, the soul has escaped and has not yet returned. In this case the soul
is expected to enter the rice and thus cause its displacement.
</p>
<p>Another method, not of recalling the soul, but of stopping it in the act of escaping,
is to take a gold ring, not less than a <i lang="ms">maiam</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21417src" href="#xd32e21417">147</a> in weight, an iron nail, a candle-nut (<i lang="ms">buah k’ras</i>), three small cockle-shells, three closed fistfuls of husked rice (<i lang="ms">b’ras tiga gĕnggam bunyi</i>), and some parti-coloured thread. These articles are all put in a rice-bag, and shaken
up together seven times every morning for three days, by which time the soul is supposed
to be firmly reseated in the patient’s body; then the rice is poured out at the door
“to let the fowls eat it.” The ring is tied to the patient’s wrist by means of a strip
of tree-bark (<i lang="ms">kulit t’rap</i>), and it is by means of this string <span class="pageNum" id="pb456">[<a href="#pb456">456</a>]</span>that the soul is supposed to return to its body. When the shaking takes place the
following charm must be recited:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peeling-Knife,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21440src" href="#xd32e21440">148</a> hooked Knife,

<p class="line">Sea-demons! Hamlet-demons!
</p>
<p class="line">Avaunt ye, begone from here,
</p>
<p class="line">And carry not off the soul of <i>So-and-so</i>,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In conclusion, I will give a quotation from <i>Malay Sketches</i>, which is perhaps as good an example as could be given of the way in which the Black
Art and the medical performances that in their methods closely resemble it, are regarded
by many respectable Malays:—
</p>
<p>“One evening I was discussing these various superstitions with the Sultan of Perak,
and I did not notice that the spiritual teacher of His Highness had entered and was
waiting to lead the evening prayer. The <i lang="ms">guru</i>, or teacher, no doubt heard the end of our conversation, and was duly scandalised,
for the next day I received from him a letter, of which the following is the translation:—
</p>
<p>“ ‘First praise to God, the Giver of all good, a Fountain of Compassion to His servants.
</p>
<p>“ ‘From Haji Wan Muhammad, Teacher of His Highness the Sultan of Perak, to the Resident
who administers the Government of Perak.
</p>
<p>“ ‘The whole earth is in the hand of the Most High God, and He gives it as an inheritance
to whom He will of His subjects. The true religion is also of God, and Heaven is the
reward of those who fear the Most High. Salvation and peace are for those <span class="pageNum" id="pb457">[<a href="#pb457">457</a>]</span>who follow the straight path, and only they will in the end arrive at real greatness.
No Raja can do good, and none can be powerful, except by the help of God, the Most
High, who is also Most Mighty.
</p>
<p>“ ‘I make ten thousand salutations. I wish to inquire about the practice of <i lang="ms">bĕr-hantu</i>, driving oneself mad and losing one’s reason, as has been the custom of Rajas and
Chiefs in this State of Perak; is it right, according to your religion, Mr. Resident,
or is it not? For that practice is a deadly sin to the Muhammadan Faith, because those
who engage in it lose their reason and waste their substance for nothing; some of
them cast it into the water, while others scatter it broadcast through the jungle.
How is such conduct treated by your religion, Mr. Resident; is it right or wrong?
I want you in your indulgence to give me an answer, for this practice is very hard
on the poor. The Headmen collect from the <i lang="ms">rayats</i>, and then they make elaborate preparations of food, killing a buffalo or fowls, and
all this is thrown away as already stated. According to the Muhammadan religion such
proceedings lead to destruction.
</p>
<p>“ ‘I salute you many times; do not be angry, for I do not understand your customs,
Mr. Resident.
</p>
<p>“ ‘(Signed) Haji Muhammad Abu Hassan.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21484src" href="#xd32e21484">149</a>

<h4 class="main"><i>Dance Ceremonies</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following passage is an account of a characteristic Malay dance, the Joget:—
</p>
<p>“Malays are not dancers, but they pay professional <span class="pageNum" id="pb458">[<a href="#pb458">458</a>]</span>performers to dance for their amusement, and consider that ‘the better part’ is with
those who watch, at their ease, the exertions of a small class, whose members are
not held in the highest respect. The spectacle usually provided is strangely wanting
in attraction: a couple of women shuffling their feet and swaying their hands in gestures
that are practically devoid of grace or even variety—that is the Malay dance—and it
is accompanied by the beating of native drums, the striking together of two short
sticks held in either hand, and the occasional boom of a metal gong. The entertainment
has an undoubted fascination for Malays, but it generally forms part of a theatrical
performance, and for Western spectators it is immeasurably dull.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21502src" href="#xd32e21502">150</a>
</p>
<p>“In one of the Malay States, however, Păhang, it has for years been the custom for
the ruler and one or two of his near relatives to keep trained dancing girls, who
perform what is called the ‘Jôget’—a real dance with an accompaniment of something
like real music, though the orchestral instruments are very rude indeed.
</p>
<p>“The dancers, <i lang="ms">bûdak jôget</i>, belong to the Raja’s household, they may even be attached to him by a closer tie;
they perform seldom, only for the amusement of their lord and his friends, and the
public are not admitted. Years ago I saw such a dance,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21514src" href="#xd32e21514">151</a> and though peculiar to Păhang, as far as the Malay States are concerned, it is probable
that it came originally from Java; the instruments used by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb459">[<a href="#pb459">459</a>]</span>orchestra and the airs played are certainly far more common in Java and Sumatra than
in the Peninsula.
</p>
<p>“I had gone to Păhang on a political mission accompanied by a friend, and we were
vainly courting sleep in a miserable lodging, when at 1 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> a message came from the Sultan inviting us to witness a <i lang="ms">jôget</i>. We accepted with alacrity, and at once made our way to the <i lang="ms">astâna</i>, a picturesque, well-built, and commodious house on the right bank of the Păhang
river. A palisade enclosed the courtyard, and the front of the house was a very large
hall, open on three sides, but covered by a lofty roof of fantastic design supported
on pillars. The floor of this hall was approached by three wide steps continued round
the three open sides, the fourth being closed by a wooden wall which entirely shut
off the private apartments save for one central door over which hung a heavy curtain.
The three steps were to provide sitting accommodation according to their rank for
those admitted to the <i lang="ms">astâna</i>. The middle of the floor on the night in question was covered by a large carpet,
chairs were placed for us, and the rest of the guests sat on the steps of the dais.
</p>
<p>“When we entered, we saw, seated on the carpet, four girls, two of them about eighteen
and two about eleven years old, all attractive according to Malay ideas of beauty,
and all gorgeously and picturesquely clothed. On their heads they each wore a large
and curious but very pretty ornament of delicate workmanship—a sort of square flower
garden where all the flowers were gold, trembling and glittering with every movement
of the wearer. These ornaments were secured to the head by twisted cords of silver
and gold. The girls’ hair, combed down in a fringe, was <span class="pageNum" id="pb460">[<a href="#pb460">460</a>]</span>cut in a perfect oval round their foreheads and very becomingly dressed behind.
</p>
<p>“The bodices of their dresses were made of tight-fitting silk, leaving the neck and
arms bare, whilst a white band of fine cambric (about one and a half inches wide),
passing round the neck, came down on the front of the bodice in the form of a <span class="xd32e21539">V</span>, and was there fastened by a golden flower. Round their waists were belts fastened
with large and curiously-worked <i lang="ms">pinding</i> or buckles of gold, so large that they reached quite across the waist. The rest of
the costume consisted of a skirt of cloth of gold (not at all like the <i lang="ms">sârong</i>), reaching to the ankles, while a scarf of the same material, fastened in its centre
to the waist-buckle, hung down to the hem of the skirt.
</p>
<p>“All four dancers were dressed alike, except that the older girls wore white silk
bodices with a red and gold handkerchief, folded corner-wise, tied under the arms
and knotted in front. The points of the handkerchief hung to the middle of the back.
In the case of the two younger girls the entire dress was of one material. On their
arms the dancers wore numbers of gold bangles, and their fingers were covered with
diamond rings. In their ears were fastened the diamond buttons so much affected by
Malays, and indeed now by Western ladies. Their feet, of course, were bare. We had
ample time to minutely observe these details before the dance commenced, for when
we came into the hall the four girls were sitting down in the usual<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21550src" href="#xd32e21550">152</a> Eastern fashion on the carpet, bending forward, their elbows resting on their thighs,
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb461">[<a href="#pb461">461</a>]</span>hiding the sides of their faces, which were towards the audience, with fans made of
crimson and gilt paper which sparkled in the light.
</p>
<p>“On our entrance the band struck up, and our special attention was called to the orchestra,
as the instruments are seldom seen in the Malay Peninsula. There were two chief performers:
one playing on a sort of harmonicon, the notes of which he struck with pieces of stick
held in each hand. The other, with similar pieces of wood, played on inverted metal
bowls. Both these performers seemed to have sufficiently hard work, but they played
with the greatest spirit from 10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> till 5 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>
</p>
<p>“The harmonicon is called by Malays <i lang="ms">chĕlempong</i>, and the inverted bowls, which give a pleasant and musical sound like the noise of
rippling water, <i lang="ms">gambang</i>. The other members of the orchestra consisted of a very small boy who played, with
a very large and thick stick, on a gigantic gong, an old woman who beat a drum with
two sticks, and several other boys who played on instruments like triangles called
<i lang="ms">chânang</i>. All these performers, we were told with much solemnity, were artists of the first
order, masters and a mistress in their craft, and if vigour of execution counts for
excellence they proved the justice of the praise.
</p>
<p>“The Hall, of considerable size, capable of accommodating several hundreds of people,
was only dimly lighted, but the fact that, while the audience was in semi-darkness,
the light was concentrated on the performers added to the effect. Besides ourselves,
I question whether there were more than twenty spectators, but sitting on the top
of the dais, near to the dancers, it was hard to pierce the surrounding gloom. The
orchestra was placed on the left of the entrance <span class="pageNum" id="pb462">[<a href="#pb462">462</a>]</span>to the Hall, that is, rather to the side and rather in the background, a position
evidently chosen with due regard to the feelings of the audience.
</p>
<p>“From the elaborate and vehement execution of the players, and the want of regular
time in the music, I judged, and rightly, that we had entered as the overture began.
During its performance the dancers sat leaning forward, hiding their faces as I have
described; but when it concluded and, without any break, the music changed into the
regular rhythm for dancing, the four girls dropped their fans, raised their hands
in the act of <i lang="ms">Sĕmbah</i> or homage, and then began the dance by swaying their bodies and slowly waving their
arms and hands in the most graceful movements making much and effective use all the
while of the scarf hanging from their belts. Gradually raising themselves from a sitting
to a kneeling posture, acting in perfect accord in every motion, then rising to their
feet, they floated through a series of figures hardly to be exceeded in grace and
difficulty, considering that the movements are essentially slow, the arms, hands,
and body being the real performers, whilst the feet are scarcely noticed and for half
the time not visible.
</p>
<p>“They danced five or six dances, each lasting quite half an hour, with materially
different figures and time in the music. All these dances, I was told, were symbolical:
one of agriculture, with the tilling of the soil, the sowing of the seed, the reaping
and winnowing of the grain, might easily have been guessed from the dancer’s movements.
But those of the audience whom I was near enough to question were, Malay-like, unable
to give me much information. Attendants stood or sat near the dancers, and from time
to time, as the <span class="pageNum" id="pb463">[<a href="#pb463">463</a>]</span>girls tossed one thing on the floor, handed them another. Sometimes it was a fan or
a mirror they held, sometimes a flower or small vessel, but oftener their hands were
empty, as it is in the management of the fingers that the chief art of Malay dancers
consists.
</p>
<p>“The last dance, symbolical of war, was perhaps the best, the music being much faster,
almost inspiriting, and the movements of the dancers more free and even abandoned.
For the latter half of the dance they each held a wand, to represent a sword, bound
with three rings of burnished gold which glittered in the light like precious stones.
This nautch, which began soberly like the others, grew to a wild revel until the dancers
were, or pretended to be, possessed by the Spirit of Dancing, <i lang="ms">hantu mĕnâri</i> as they called it, and leaving the Hall for a moment to smear their fingers and faces
with a fragrant oil, they returned, and the two eldest, striking at each other with
their wands, seemed inclined to turn the symbolical into a real battle. They were,
however, after some trouble, caught by four or five women and carried forcibly out
of the Hall, but not until their captors had been made to feel the weight of the magic
wands. The two younger girls, who looked as if they too would like to be “possessed,”
but did not know how to accomplish it, were easily caught and removed.
</p>
<p>“The bands, whose strains had been increasing in wildness and in time, ceased playing
on the removal of the dancers, and the nautch, which had begun at 10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, was over.
</p>
<p>“The Raja, who had only appeared at 4 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, told me that one of the elder girls, when she became “properly possessed,” lived
for months on nothing but flowers, a pretty and poetic conceit.
</p>
<p>“As we left the Astana, and taking boat rowed <span class="pageNum" id="pb464">[<a href="#pb464">464</a>]</span>slowly to the vessel waiting for us off the river’s mouth, the rising sun was driving
the fog from the numbers of lovely green islets, that seemed to float like dew-drenched
lotus leaves on the surface of the shallow stream.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21607src" href="#xd32e21607">153</a>”

flowers, etc., which is used to represent a pleasure garden (<i lang="ms">taman bunga</i>) for the attraction of the dance-spirit. The bird at the top of it is a hornbill.
</p>
<p><i>Page 464.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>The religious origin of almost all Malay dances is still to be seen in the performance
of such ritualistic observances as the burning of incense, the scattering of rice,
and the invocation of the Dance-spirit according to certain set forms, the spirit
being duly exorcised again (or “escorted homewards,” as it is called) at the end of
the performance.
</p>
<p>The dances which have best preserved the older ritual are precisely those which are
the least often seen, such as the “Gambor Dance” (<i lang="ms">main gambor</i>), the “Monkey Dance” (<i lang="ms">main b’rok</i>), the “Palm-blossom Dance” (<i lang="ms">main mayang</i>), and the “Fish-trap Dance” (<i lang="ms">main lukah</i>). These I will take in the order mentioned.
</p>
<p>The “Gambor Dance” (lit. Gambor Play) should be performed by girls just entering upon
womanhood. The <i lang="fr">débutante</i> is attired in an attractive coat and skirt (<i lang="ms">sarong</i>), is girt about at the waist with a yellow (royal) sash, and is further provided
with an elaborate head-dress, crescent-shaped pendants (<i lang="ms">dokoh</i>) for the breast, and a fan. The only other “necessary” is the “Pleasure-garden” (<i lang="ms">taman bunga</i>), which is represented by a large water-jar containing a bunch of long sprays, from
the ends of which are made to depend artificial flowers, fruit, and birds, the whole
being intended to attract the spirit (Hantu Gambor). In addition there is the usual
circular tray, with its complement of sacrificial rice and incense. Everything <span class="pageNum" id="pb465">[<a href="#pb465">465</a>]</span>being ready, the <i lang="fr">débutante</i> lies down and is covered over with a sheet, and incense is burnt, the sacrificial
rice sprinkled, and the invocation of the spirit is chanted by a woman to the accompaniment
of the tambourines. Ere it has ended, if all goes well, the charm will have begun
to work, the spirit descends, and the dance commences.
</p>
<p>At the end of this dance, as has already been said, the spirit is exorcised, that
is, he is “escorted back” to the seventh heaven from whence he came.
</p>
<p>The invocations, which are used both at the commencement and the conclusion of the
performance, consist of poems which belong unmistakably to the “Panji” cycle of stories;
here and there they contain old words which are still used in Java.
</p>
<p>The “Monkey Dance” is achieved by causing the “Monkey spirit” to enter into a girl
of some ten years of age. She is first rocked to and fro in a Malay infant’s swinging-cot
(<i lang="ms">buayan</i>), and fed with areca-nut and salt (<i lang="ms">pinang garam</i>). When she is sufficiently dizzy or “dazed” (<i lang="ms">mabok</i>), an invocation addressed to the “Monkey spirit” is chanted (to tambourine accompaniments),
and at its close the child commences to perform a dance, in the course of which she
is said sometimes to achieve some extraordinary climbing feats which she could never
have achieved unless “possessed.” When it is time for her to recover her senses she
is called upon by name, and if that fails to recall her, is bathed all over with cocoa-nut
milk (<i lang="ms">ayer niyor hijau</i>).
</p>
<p>The foregoing does not, of course, in any way exhaust the list of Malay dances. Others
will be found described in various parts of this book, amongst them the “Henna Dance”
(at weddings); the medicine-man’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb466">[<a href="#pb466">466</a>]</span>dance, as performed at the bedside of a sick person; the dance performed in honour
of a dead tiger; theatrical dances, and many kinds of sword and dagger dances, or
posture-dances (such as the <i lang="ms">main bĕrsilat</i>, or <i lang="ms">main bĕrpĕnchak</i>), whether performed for the diversion of the beholders or by way of defiance (as
in war). The <i lang="ms">main dabus</i> is a dance performed with a species of iron spits, whose upper ends are furnished
with hoops, upon which small iron rings are strung, and which accordingly give out
a jingling noise when shaken. Two of these spits (<i lang="ms">buah dabus</i>) are charmed (to deaden their bite), and taken up, one in each hand, by the dancer,
who shakes them at each step that he takes. When he is properly possessed, he drives
the points of these spits through the muscle of each forearm, and lets them hang down
whilst he takes up a second pair. He then keeps all four spits jingling at once until
the dance ceases. The point of each spit goes right through the muscle, but if skilfully
done, draws no blood.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21697src" href="#xd32e21697">154</a>

(which are in correct proportion), and overhead the ornamental clothes-rod with clothes.
The tree-like object on the left is the <i lang="ms">sĕtakona</i>: it is the only object out of proportion, being too large. Rolled up in front are
the striped hangings used at Malay weddings.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>We now come to a class of dances in which certain inanimate objects, that are believed
to be temporarily animated, are the performers, and which therefore closely correspond
to the performances of our own spiritualists.
</p>
<p>The Palm-blossom dance is a very curious exhibition, which I once saw performed in
the Langat District of Selangor. Two freshly-gathered sheaves of areca-palm blossom
(each several feet in length) were deposited upon a new mat, near a tray containing
a censer and the three kinds of sacrificial rice.
</p>
<p>The magician (’Che Ganti by name) commenced the performance by playing a prelude on
his violin. <span class="pageNum" id="pb467">[<a href="#pb467">467</a>]</span>Presently his wife (an aged Selangor woman) took some of the rice in her hand and
commenced to chant the words of the invocation, she being almost immediately joined
in the chant by a younger woman. Starting with the words, “Thus I brace up, I brace
up the Palm-blossom” (<i lang="ms">’ku anggit mayang ’ku anggit</i>), their voices rose higher and higher until the seventh stanza was reached, when
the old woman covered the two sheaves of Palm-blossom with a Malay plaid skirt (<i lang="ms">sarong</i>) and the usual “five cubits of white cloth” (folded double), both of which had of
course first been fumigated. Then followed seven more stanzas (“Borrow the hammer,
Borrow the anvil,” and its companion verses), and rice having been thrown over one
of the sheaves of palm-blossom, its sheath was opened and the contents fumigated.
Then the old woman took the newly-fumigated sheaf between her hands, and the chant
recommenced with the third septet of stanzas (“Dig up, dig up, the wild ginger plant”),
as the erect palm-blossom swayed from side to side in time to the music. Finally the
fiddle stopped and tambourines were substituted, and at this point the sheaf of blossom
commenced to jump about on its stalk, as if it were indeed possessed, and eventually
dashed itself upon the ground. After one or two repetitions of this performance, other
persons present were invited to try it, and did so with varying success, which depended,
I was told, upon the impressionability of their souls, as the palm-blossom <i>would not dance for anybody whose soul was not impressionable</i> (<span lang="ms">lĕmah sĕmangat</span>).
</p>
<p>When the first blossom-sheaf had been destroyed by the rough treatment which it had
to undergo, the second was duly fumigated and introduced to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb468">[<a href="#pb468">468</a>]</span>company, and finally the performance was brought to a close by the chanting of the
stanzas in which the spirit is requested to return to his own place. The two spoiled
sheaves of blossom were then carried respectfully out of the house and laid on the
ground beneath a banana-tree.
</p>
<p>The Dancing Fish-trap (<i lang="ms">main lukah</i>) is a spiritualistic performance, in which a fish-trap (<i lang="ms">lukah</i>) is substituted for the sheaf of palm-blossom, and a different invocation is used.
In other respects there is very little difference between the two. The fish-trap is
dressed up much in the same way as a “scare-crow,” so as to present a rough and ready
resemblance to the human figure, <i>i.e.</i> it is dressed in a <i>woman’s</i> coat and plaid skirt (<i lang="ms">sarong</i>), both of which must, if possible, have been <i>worn</i> previously; a stick is run through it to serve as the arms of the figure, and a (sterile)
cocoa-nut shell (<i lang="ms">tĕmpurong jantan</i>) clapped on the top to serve as a head. The invocation is then chanted in the same
manner and to the same accompaniment as that used for the “Palm-blossom.” At its conclusion
the magician whispers, so to speak, into the fish-trap’s ear, bidding it “not to disgrace
him,” but rise up and dance, and the fish-trap presently commences to rock to and
fro, and to leap about in a manner which of course proves it to be “possessed” by
the spirit. Two different specimens of the invocations used will be found in the Appendix.

<h4 class="main"><i>Buffalo Fights and Cock Fights</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The Malays are passionately addicted to buffalo and cock fighting. Whole poems are
devoted to enthusiastic descriptions of these ‘sports of princes,’ <span class="pageNum" id="pb469">[<a href="#pb469">469</a>]</span>and laws laid down for the latter as minute as those of the Hoyleian code.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21771src" href="#xd32e21771">155</a>
</p>
<p>“The bulls have been trained and medicined for months beforehand, with much careful
tending, many strength-giving potions, and volumes of the old-world charms, which
put valour and courage into a beast. They stand at each end of a piece of grassy lawn,
with their knots of admirers around them, descanting on their various points, and
with the proud trainer, who is at once keeper and medicine-man, holding them by the
cord which is passed through their nose-rings. Until you have seen the water-buffalo
stripped for the fight, it is impossible to conceive how handsome the ugly brute can
look. One has been accustomed to see him with his neck bowed to the yoke he hates,
and breaks whenever the opportunity offers; or else in the <i lang="ms">pâdi</i> fields. In the former case he looks out of place,—an anachronism belonging to a prehistoric
period, drawing a cart which seems also to date back to the days before the Deluge.
In the fields the buffalo has usually a complete suit of grey mud, and during the
quiet evening hour goggles at you through the clouds of flies which surround his flapping
ears and brutal nose, the only parts that can be seen of him above the surface of
the mud-hole or the running water of the river. In both cases he is unlovely, but
in the bull-ring he has something magnificent about him. His black coat has a gloss
upon it which would not disgrace a London carriage horse, and which shows him to be
in tip-top condition. His neck seems thicker and more powerful than that of any other
animal, and it glistens with the <i>chili</i> water, which has been poured over it in order to increase his excitement. His <span class="pageNum" id="pb470">[<a href="#pb470">470</a>]</span>resolute shoulders, his straining quarters,—each vying with the other for the prize
for strength,—and his great girth, give a look of astonishing vigour and vitality
to the animal. It is the head of the buffalo, however, which it is best to look at
on these occasions. Its great spread of horns is very imposing, and the eyes, which
are usually sleepy, cynically contemptuous and indifferent, or sullenly cruel, are
for once full of life, anger, passion, and excitement. He stands there quivering and
stamping, blowing great clouds of smoke from his mouth and nose:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,
</p>
<p class="line">And with circles of red for his eye-socket’s rim.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">“The wild joy of battle is sending the blood boiling through the great arteries of
the beast, and his accustomed lethargic existence is galvanised into a new fierce
life. You can see that he is longing for the battle with an ardour that would have
distanced that of a Quixote, and, for the first time, you begin to see something to
admire even in the water-buffalo.
</p>
<p>“A crowd of <i>Râjas</i>, Chiefs, and commoners are assembled, in their gaily-coloured garments, which always
serve to give life and beauty to every Malay picture, with its setting of brilliant
never-fading green. The women in their gaudy silks, and dainty veils, glance coquettishly
from behind the fenced enclosure which has been prepared for their protection, and
where they are quite safe from injury. The young <i>Râjas</i> stalk about, examine the bulls, and give loud and contradictory orders as to the
manner in which the fight is to be conducted. The keepers, fortunately, are so deafened
by the row which every one near them is making, that they are utterly incapable of
following <span class="pageNum" id="pb471">[<a href="#pb471">471</a>]</span>directions which they cannot hear. Malays love many people and many things, and one
of the latter is the sound of their own voices. When they are excited—and in the bull-ring
they are always wild with excitement—they wax very noisy indeed, and, as they all
talk, and no one listens to what any one else is saying, the green sward on which
the combat is to take place speedily becomes a pandemonium, compared with which the
Tower of Babel was a quiet corner in Sleepy Hollow.
</p>
<p>“At last the word to begin is given, and the keepers of the buffaloes let out the
lines made fast to the bulls’ noses, and lead their charges to the centre of the green.
The lines are crossed, and then gradually drawn taut, so that the bulls are soon facing
one another. Then the knots are loosed, and the cords slip from the nose-rings. A
dead silence falls upon the people, and for a moment the combatants eye one another.
Then they rush together, forehead to forehead, with a mighty impact. A fresh roar
rends the sky, the backers of each beast shrieking advice and encouragement to the
bull which carries their money.
</p>
<p>“After the first rush, the bulls no longer charge, but stand with interlaced horns,
straining shoulders, and quivering quarters, bringing tremendous pressure to bear
one upon the other, while each strives to get a grip with the point of its horns upon
the neck, or cheeks, or face of its opponent. A buffalo’s horn is not sharp, but the
weight of the animal is enormous, and you must remember that the horns are driven
with the whole of the brute’s bulk for lever and sledgehammer. Such force as is exerted
would be almost sufficient to push a crowbar through a stone wall, and, tough though
they are, the hardest of old bull buffaloes <span class="pageNum" id="pb472">[<a href="#pb472">472</a>]</span>is not proof against the terrible pressure brought to bear. The bulls show wonderful
activity and skill in these fencing matches. Each beast gives way the instant that
it is warned by the touch of the horn-tip that its opponent has found an opening,
and woe betide the bull that puts its weight into a stab which the other has time
to elude. In the flick of an eye—as the Malay phrase has it—advantage is taken of
the blunder, and, before the bull has time to recover its lost balance, its opponent
has found an opening, and has wedged its horn-point into the neck or cheek. When at
last a firm grip has been won, and the horn has been driven into the yielding flesh,
as far as the struggles of its opponent render possible, the stabber makes his great
effort. Pulling his hind-legs well under him, and straightening his fore-legs to the
utmost extent, till the skin is drawn taut over the projecting bosses of bone at the
shoulders, and the knots of muscle stand out like cordage on a crate, he lifts his
opponent. His head is skewed on one side, so that the horn on which his adversary
is hooked is raised to the highest level possible, and his massive neck strains and
quivers with the tremendous effort. If the stab is sufficiently low down, say in the
neck or under the cheek-bone, the wounded bull is often lifted clean off his fore-feet,
and hangs there helpless and motionless ‘while a man might count a score.’ The exertion
of lifting, however, is too great to admit of its being continued for any length of
time, and as soon as the wounded buffalo regains its power of motion—that is to say,
as soon as its fore-feet are again on the ground—it speedily releases itself from
its adversary’s horn. Then, since the latter is often spent by the extraordinary effort
which has been made, it frequently <span class="pageNum" id="pb473">[<a href="#pb473">473</a>]</span>happens that it is stabbed and lifted in its turn before balance has been completely
recovered.
</p>
<p>“Once, and only once, have I seen a bull succeed in throwing his opponent, after he
had lifted it off its feet. The vanquished bull turned over on its back before it
succeeded in regaining its feet, but the victor was itself too used up to more than
make a ghost of a stab at the exposed stomach of its adversary. This throw is still
spoken of in Pahang as the most marvellous example of skill and strength which has
ever been called forth within living memory by any of these contests.
</p>
<p>“As the stabs follow one another, to the sound of the clicking of the horns and the
mighty blowing and snorting of the breathless bulls, lift succeeds lift with amazing
rapidity. The green turf is stamped into mud by the great hoofs of the labouring brutes,
and at length one bull owns himself to be beaten. Down goes his head—that sure sign
of exhaustion—and in a moment he has turned round and is off on a bee-line, hotly
pursued by the victor. The chase is never a long one, as the conqueror always abandons
it at the end of a few hundred yards, but while it lasts it is fast and furious, and
woe betide the man who finds himself in the way of either of the excited animals.
</p>
<p>“Mr. Kipling has told us all about the Law of the Jungle—which after all is only the
code of man, adapted to the use of the beasts by Mr. Rudyard Kipling—but those who
know the ways of buffaloes are aware that they possess one very well-recognised law.
This is, ‘Thou shalt not commit trespass.’ Every buffalo-bull has its own ground;
and into this no other bull willingly comes. If he is brought there to do battle,
he fights with very little heart, and is <span class="pageNum" id="pb474">[<a href="#pb474">474</a>]</span>easily vanquished by an opponent of half his strength and bulk who happens to be fighting
on his own land. When bulls are equally matched, they are taken to fight on neutral
ground. When they are badly matched the land owned by the weaker is selected for the
scene of the contest.
</p>
<p>“All these fights are brutal, and in time they will, we trust, be made illegal. To
pass a prohibitionary regulation, however, without the full consent of the Chiefs
and people of Pahang would be a distinct breach of the understanding on which British
Protection was accepted by them. The Government is pledged not to interfere with native
customs, and the sports in which animals are engaged are among the most cherished
institutions of the people of Pahang. To fully appreciate the light in which any interference
with these things would be viewed by the native population, it is necessary to put
oneself in the position of a keen member of the Quorn, who saw Parliament making hunting
illegal, on the grounds that the sufferings inflicted on the fox rendered it an inhuman
pastime. As I have said in a former chapter, the natives of Pahang are, in their own
way, very keen sportsmen indeed; and, when all is said and done, it is doubtful whether
hunting is not more cruel than anything which takes place in a Malay cock-pit or bull-ring.
The longer the run the better the sport, and more intense and prolonged the agony
of the fox, that strives to run for his life, even when he is so stiff with exertion
that he can do little more than roll along. All of us have, at one time or another,
experienced in nightmares the agony of attempting to fly from some pursuing phantom,
when our limbs refuse to serve us. This, I fancy, is much what a fox <span class="pageNum" id="pb475">[<a href="#pb475">475</a>]</span>suffers, only his pains are intensified by the grimness of stern reality. If he stops
he loses his life, therefore he rolls, and flounders, and creeps along when every
movement has become a fresh torture. The cock, quail, dove, bull, ram, or fish,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21815src" href="#xd32e21815">156</a> on the other hand, fights because it is his nature to do so, and when he has had
his fill he stops. His pluck, his pride, and his hatred of defeat alone urge him to
continue the contest. He is never driven by the relentless whip of stern, inexorable
necessity. This it is which makes fights between animals, that are properly conducted,
less cruel than one is apt to imagine.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21820src" href="#xd32e21820">157</a>
</p>
<p>I will now pass to the subject of cock-fighting, of which the following vivid description
is also taken from Mr. Clifford’s <i>In Court and Kampong</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21828src" href="#xd32e21828">158</a>
</p>
<p>“In the Archipelago, and on the West Coast of the Peninsula, cock-fights are conducted
in the manner known to the Malays as <i lang="ms">bĕr-tâji</i>, the birds being armed with long artificial spurs, sharp as razors, and curved like
a Malay woman’s eyebrow. These weapons make cruel wounds, and cause the death of one
or other of the combatants almost before the sport has well begun. To the Malay of
the East Coast this form of cock-fighting is regarded as stupid and unsportsmanlike,
an opinion which I fully share. It is the marvellous pluck and endurance of the birds
that lend <span class="pageNum" id="pb476">[<a href="#pb476">476</a>]</span>an interest to a cock-fight—qualities which are in no way required if the birds are
armed with weapons other than those with which they are furnished by nature.
</p>
<p>“A cock-fight between two well-known birds is a serious affair in Pahang. The rival
qualities of the combatants have furnished food for endless discussion for weeks,
or even months, before, and every one of standing has visited and examined the cocks,
and has made a book upon the event. On the day fixed for the fight a crowd collects
before the palace, and some of the King’s youths set up the cock-pit, which is a ring,
about three feet in diameter, enclosed by canvas walls, supported on stakes driven
into the ground. Presently the <i lang="ms">Juâra</i>, or cock-fighters, appear, each carrying his bird under his left arm. They enter
the cock-pit, squat down, and begin pulling at, and shampooing the legs and wings
of their birds, in the manner which Malays believe loosen the muscles, and get the
reefs out of the cocks’ limbs. Then the word is given to start the fight, and the
birds, released, fly straight at one another, striking with their spurs, and sending
feathers flying in all directions. This lasts for perhaps three minutes, when the
cocks begin to lose their wind, and the fight is carried on as much with their beaks
as with their spurs. Each bird tries to get its head under its opponent’s wing, running
forward to strike at the back of its antagonist’s head, as soon as its own emerges
from under its temporary shelter. This is varied by an occasional blow with the spurs,
and the Malays herald each stroke with loud cries of approval. <i lang="ms">Bâsah! Bâsah!</i> ‘Thou hast wetted him! Thou hast drawn blood!’ <i lang="ms">Ah itu dia!</i> ‘That is it! That is a good one!’ <i lang="ms">Ah sâkit-lah itu!</i> ‘Ah, that was a nasty one!’ And the birds are exhorted to make fresh <span class="pageNum" id="pb477">[<a href="#pb477">477</a>]</span>efforts, amid occasional burst of the shrill chorus of yells, called <i lang="ms">sôrak</i>, their backers cheering them on, and crying to them by name.
</p>
<p>“Presently time is called, the watch being a small section of cocoa-nut in which a
hole has been bored, that is set floating on the surface of a jar of water, until
it gradually becomes filled and sinks. At the word, each cock-fighter seizes his bird,
drenches it with water, cleans out with a feather the phlegm which has collected in
its throat, and shampoos its legs and body. Then, at the given word, the birds are
again released, and they fly at one another with renewed energy. They lose their wind
more speedily this time, and thereafter they pursue the tactics already described
until time is again called. When some ten rounds have been fought, and both the birds
are beginning to show signs of distress, the interest of the contest reaches its height,
for the fight is at an end if either bird raises its back feathers in a peculiar manner,
by which cocks declare themselves to be vanquished. Early in the tenth round the right
eye-ball of one cock is broken, and, shortly after, the left eye is bunged up, so
that for the time it is blind. Nevertheless, it refuses to throw up the sponge, and
fights on gallantly to the end of the round, taking terrible punishment, and doing
but little harm to its opponent. One cannot but be full of pity and admiration for
the brave bird, which thus gives so marvellous an example of its pluck and endurance.
At last time is called, and the cock-fighter who is in charge of the blinded bird,
after examining it carefully, asks for a needle and thread, and the swollen lower
lid of the still uninjured eye-ball is sewn to the piece of membrane on the bird’s
cheek, and its sight is thus once more partially restored. <span class="pageNum" id="pb478">[<a href="#pb478">478</a>]</span>Again time is called, and the birds resume their contest, the cock with the injured
eye repaying its adversary so handsomely for the punishment which it had received
in the previous round, that, before the cocoa-nut shell is half full of water, its
opponent has surrendered, and has immediately been snatched up by the keeper in charge
of it. The victorious bird, draggled and woebegone, with great patches of red flesh
showing through its wet plumage, with the membrane of its face and its short gills
and comb swollen and bloody, with one eye put out, and the other only kept open by
the thread attached to its eyelid, yet makes shift to strut, with staggering gait,
across the cock-pit, and to notify its victory by giving vent to a lamentable ghost
of a crow. Then it is carried off followed by an admiring, gesticulating, vociferous
crowd, to be elaborately tended and nursed, as befits so gallant a bird. The beauty
of the sport is that either bird can stop fighting at any moment. They are never forced
to continue the conflict if once they have declared themselves defeated, and the only
real element of cruelty is thus removed. The birds in fighting follow the instinct
which nature has implanted in them, and their marvellous courage and endurance surpass
anything to be found in any other animals, human or otherwise, with which I am acquainted.
Most birds fight more or less—from the little fierce quail to the sucking doves which
ignorant Europeans, before their illusions have been dispelled by a sojourn in the
East, are accustomed to regard as the emblems of peace and purity; but no bird, or
beast, or fish, or human being fights so well, or takes such pleasure in the fierce
joy of battle, as does a plucky, lanky, ugly, hard-bit old fighting-cock.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb479">[<a href="#pb479">479</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The Malays regard these birds with immense respect, and value their fighting-cocks
next to their children. A few years ago, a boy, who was in charge of a cock which
belonged to a <i lang="ms">Râja</i> of my acquaintance, accidentally pulled some feathers from the bird’s tail. ‘What
did you do that for? Devil!’ cried the <i lang="ms">Râja</i>.
</p>
<p>“ ‘It was not done on purpose, <i lang="ms">Ungku!</i>’ said the boy.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Thou art marvellous clever at repartee!’ quoth the Prince, and, so saying, he lifted
a billet of wood, which chanced to be lying near at hand, and smote the boy on the
head so that he died.
</p>
<p>“ ‘That will teach my people to have a care how they use my fighting-cocks!’ said
the <i lang="ms">Râja</i>; and that was his servant’s epitaph.
</p>
<p>“ ‘It is a mere boyish prank,’ said the father of the young <i lang="ms">Râja</i>, when the matter was reported to him, ‘and, moreover, it is well that he should slay
one or two with his own hand, else how should men learn to fear him?’ And there the
matter ended; but it should be borne in mind that the fighting-cock of a Malay Prince
is not to be lightly trifled with.”
</p>
<p>Of the form of cock-fighting practised on the West Coast of the Peninsula Newbold
writes:—
</p>
<p>“The following is a specimen from a Malay MS. on the subject, commencing with remarks
on the various breeds of this noble bird:—
</p>
<p>“The best breeds of game-cocks are the Biring, the Jalak, the Teddong, the Chenantan,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21893src" href="#xd32e21893">159</a> the Ijou, the Pilas, the Bongkas,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21897src" href="#xd32e21897">160</a> the Su, the Belurong,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21901src" href="#xd32e21901">161</a> and the Krabu.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21905src" href="#xd32e21905">162</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb480">[<a href="#pb480">480</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The colour of the Biring is red with yellow feet and beak.
</p>
<p>“The Jalak is white mixed with black, with yellow feet, and beak also yellow mixed
with black.
</p>
<p>“The Teddong has black eyes and legs, red and black plumage, and a black beak. It
is named from a sort of serpent, whose bite is accounted mortal.
</p>
<p>“The Chenantan has white feathers, feet, and beak.
</p>
<p>“The Ijou has a greenish black beak, feathers black mixed with white, legs green.
</p>
<p>“The Pilas has a black beak, red and black feathers, legs white mixed with black.
</p>
<p>“The Bongkas has a yellow beak, white feathers and yellow feet.
</p>
<p>“The Su has a white beak with white spots, plumage white and black, legs white with
black spots.
</p>
<p>“The Belurong has a white beak with red spots, plumage red, white feet.
</p>
<p>“The Krabu has a red beak mixed with yellow, red feathers and yellow feet.
</p>
<p>“There are two kinds of spurs: first, the Golok Golok, in the form of a straight knife
known by this name and in use with the Malays; and, secondly, the Taji Benkok, or
curved spur: the last is most in vogue.
</p>
<p>“There are various modes of tying on the spur, viz. Salik, or below the natural spur;
Kumbar, on a level with it; Panggong, above the spur; Sa ibu Tangan, a thumb’s breadth
below the knee joint; Sa Kalinking, a little finger’s breadth; Andas Bulu, close to
the feathers under the knee; Jankir, upon the little toe; Sauh wongkang, on the middle
toe; Berchingkama, tying the three large toes together with the spur—this is the most
advantageous; Golok, binding the little <span class="pageNum" id="pb481">[<a href="#pb481">481</a>]</span>toe and the toe on the left with the spur; Golok di Battang, below the natural spur.
It is necessary to observe that the Malays generally use one spur; though two spurs
are sometimes given to match a weaker against a stronger bird.
</p>
<p>“1. The winner takes the dead bird.
</p>
<p>“2. If a drawn battle (Sri) each takes his own.
</p>
<p>“3. No person but the holder shall interfere with the cocks after they have been once
set to, even if one of them run away, except by the permission of the Juara, or setter-to.
Should any person do so, and the cock eventually win the battle, the owners shall
be entitled to half the stakes only.
</p>
<p>“4. Should one of the cocks run away, and the wounded one pursue it, both birds shall
be caught and held by their Juaras. Should the runaway cock refuse to peck at its
adversary three times, the wings shall be twined over the back, and it shall be put
on the ground for its adversary to peck at; should he too refuse, after it has been
three times presented, it is a Sri, or drawn battle. The cock that pecks wins.
</p>
<p>“5. The stakes on both sides must be forthcoming and deposited on the spot.
</p>
<p>“6. A cock shall not be taken up unless the spur be broken, even by the Juaras.
</p>
<p>“When a cock has won his disposition changes.
</p>
<p>“A cock is called Cheyma when he chooses round grains of paddy, or fights with his
shadow, or spurs or pecks at people.
</p>
<p>“The Malays believe in the influence of certain periods in the day over the breeds
of cocks. They will not bet upon a bird with black plumage that is matched against
one with yellow and white at the period Kutika Miswara; nor against a black one set
<span class="pageNum" id="pb482">[<a href="#pb482">482</a>]</span>to with a white one at the period Kutika Kala. Kutika Sri is favourable in this case
for the white feathered bird. Kutika Brahma is propitious to a red cock matched against
a light grey; and Kutika Vishnu for a green cock.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21939src" href="#xd32e21939">163</a>
</p>
<p>“I once witnessed a grand contest between two Malayan States at the breaking up of
the Ramazan fast. Most of the cock-fighters presented themselves at the Golongan or
cock-pit with a game-cock under each arm. The birds were not trimmed as in England,
but fought in full feather. The spurs used on this occasion were about two and a half
inches long, in shape like the blade of a scythe, and were sharpened on the spot by
means of a fine whetstone; large gashes were inflicted by these murderous instruments,
and it rarely happened that both cocks survived the battle. Cocks of the same colour
are seldom matched. The weight is adjusted by the setters-to passing them to and from
each other’s hands as they sit facing each other in the Golongan. Should there be
any difference, it is brought down to an equality by the spur being fixed so many
scales higher on the leg of the heavier cock, or according to rules adverted to, as
deemed fair by both parties. One spur only is used, and is generally fastened near
the natural spur on the inside of the left leg. In adjusting these preliminaries the
professional skill of the setters-to is called into action, and much time is taken
up in grave deliberation, which often terminates in wrangling. The birds, after various
methods of irritating them have been practised, are then set to. During the continuance
of the battle, the excitement and interest taken by the Malays in the barbarous exhibition
is vividly depicted in their <span class="pageNum" id="pb483">[<a href="#pb483">483</a>]</span>animated looks and gestures—everything they possess in the world being often staked
on the issue.
</p>
<p>“The breed of cocks on the Peninsula more resembles the game-fowl of England than
the large lanky breed known in Europe under the term ‘Malay.’ Great attention is paid
by natives to the breed and feeding of game-cocks.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21951src" href="#xd32e21951">164</a>

<p class="first">“Gambling of various descriptions, both with dice and with cards, is much in vogue.
These, as well as the poe-table, have been introduced by the Chinese, who are even
greater adepts than the Malays in all that relates to this pernicious vice.
</p>
<p>“Saparaga<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21962src" href="#xd32e21962">165</a> is a game resembling football, played by ten or twenty youths and men, who stand
in a circle, keeping up a hollow ratan ball in the air, which is passed to and fro
by the action of the knees and feet—the object being to prevent the ball from touching
the ground; it is frequently, however, taken at the rebound. The awkwardness of novices
occasions great merriment.
</p>
<p>“The Sangheta<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21971src" href="#xd32e21971">166</a> is a game implicating broken heads; but, properly speaking, is a ‘<span lang="la">vi et armis</span>’ mode of arbitration in matters of dispute between two Sukus or tribes. A certain
number of men from each tribe turn out and pelt each other with sticks and logs of
wood, until one of the parties gives in. The victors in this petty tourney are presumed
to have the right on their side.
</p>
<p>“The Malays are remarkably attached to singing <span class="pageNum" id="pb484">[<a href="#pb484">484</a>]</span>reciprocal Pantuns, stanzas comprising four alternate rhyming lines, of which notice
has been taken elsewhere. Poetical contests in the Bucolic style are often carried
on to a great length by means of Pantuns. To music Malays are passionately devoted,
particularly to that of the violin. They evince a good ear, and great readiness in
committing to memory even European airs. A voyage or journey of any length is seldom
undertaken by the better classes without a minstrel.
</p>
<p>“Takki Takki<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21986src" href="#xd32e21986">167</a> are riddles and enigmas, to the propounding and solving of which the females and
educated classes of the people are much inclined.

<p>“The games played by children are Tujoh Lobang,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21998src" href="#xd32e21998">168</a> Punting, Chimpli, Kechil Krat, Kuboh, etc.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22005src" href="#xd32e22005">169</a>
</p>
<p>Of all minor games, top-spinning and kite-flying are perhaps the most popular. The
kites are called <i lang="ms">layang-layang</i>, which means a “swallow,” but are sometimes of great size, one which was brought
to me at Langat measuring some six feet in height by about seven feet between the
tips of the wings. The peculiarity of the Malay kite is that it presents a convex,
instead of a concave, surface to the wind, and that no “tail” is required, the kite
being steadied by means of a beak which projects forward at the top of the framework.
They are also usually provided with a thin, horizontal slip of bamboo (<i lang="ms">dĕngong</i>) stretched tightly behind the beak, and which hums loudly in the wind. They are of
a great number of different but well-recognised patterns, such as the <span class="pageNum" id="pb485">[<a href="#pb485">485</a>]</span>“Fighting Dragons” (<i lang="ms">Naga bĕrjuang</i>), the Crescent (<i lang="ms">Sahari bulan</i>), the Eagle (<i lang="ms">Rajawali</i>), the Bird of Paradise (<i lang="ms">Chĕndrawasih</i>), and so forth. A small kind of roughly-made kite is, as is well known, used at Singapore
for fishing purposes, but I have never yet met with any instance of their being used
ceremonially, though it is quite certain that grown-ups will fly them with quite as
much zest as children.
</p>
<p>Top-spinning, again, is a favourite pastime among the Malays, and is played by old
and young of all ranks with the same eagerness.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22035src" href="#xd32e22035">170</a> The most usual form of top is not unlike the English pegtop, but has a shorter peg.
It is spun in the same way and with the same object as our own pegtop, the object
being to split the top of one’s opponent.
</p>
<p>Teetotums are also used, and I have seen in Selangor a species of bamboo humming-top,
but was told that it was copied from a humming-top used by the Chinese.
</p>
<p>“The game of chess, which has been introduced from Arabia,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22058src" href="#xd32e22058">171</a> is played in almost precisely the same manner as among Europeans, but the queen,
instead of being placed upon her own colour, is stationed at the right hand of the
king. In the Malay game the king, if he has not been checked, can be castled, but
over one space only, not over two, as in the English game. The king may, also, before
he is checked or moved from his own square, move once, like a knight, either to left
or right, and he may also, if he has not <span class="pageNum" id="pb486">[<a href="#pb486">486</a>]</span>moved or been checked, move once over <i>two vacant</i> squares instead of one.” The following are the names of the pieces:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1.</span> <i lang="ms">Raja</i>, the King.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2.</span> <i lang="ms">Mĕntri</i> (“Minister”), the Queen.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">3.</span> <i lang="ms">Têr</i> or <i lang="ms">Tor</i>, the Castle.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">4.</span> <i lang="ms">Gajah</i> (“Elephant”), the Bishop.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">5.</span> <i lang="ms">Kuda</i> (“Horse”), the Knight.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">6.</span> <i lang="ms">Bidak</i>, the Pawns.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22111src" href="#xd32e22111">172</a></li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Main chongkak</i>, again, is a game played with a board (<i lang="ms">papan chongkak</i>) consisting of a boat-shaped block.
</p>
<p>In the top of this block (where the boat’s deck would be) are sunk a double row of
holes, the rows containing eight holes each, and two more holes are added, one at
each end. Each of the eight holes (in both rows) is filled at starting with eight
<i lang="ms">buah gorek</i> (the <i lang="ms">buah gorek</i> being the fruit of a common tree, also called <i lang="ms">kĕlichi</i> in Malacca). There are usually two players who pick the <i lang="ms">buah gorek</i> out of the holes in turn, and deposit them in the next hole according to certain
fixed rules of numerical combination, a solitary <i lang="ms">buah gorek</i>, wherever it is found, being put back and compelled to recommence its journey down
the board.
</p>
<p>A similar game is, I believe, known in many parts of the East, and was formerly much
played even by Malay slaves, who used to make the double row of holes in the ground
when no board was obtainable.
</p>
<p>The Malay game of Draughts (<i lang="ms">main dam</i>) is played, I believe, in exactly the same manner as the English game. Backgammon
(<i lang="ms">main tabal</i>), on the other hand, is played in two different ways.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb487">[<a href="#pb487">487</a>]</span></p>
<p>The “Tiger” Game (<i lang="ms">main rimau</i>), or “Tiger and Goat” Game (<i lang="ms">main rimau kambing</i>), is a game which has a distinct resemblance to our own “fox and goose,” there being
usually four tigers to a dozen of the goats.

<p>“Three cards are dealt out to each player. The highest hand counting by pips is that
which contains the greatest number of pips after the tens are deducted. Thus a knave,
ten, and nine is a good hand.
</p>
<p>“The best hand is three aces, <i lang="ms">Sat tiga</i>.
</p>
<p>“The next best is three court-cards, <i lang="ms">Kuda</i>; <i lang="ms">naik kuda</i>.
</p>
<p>“The next is nine.
</p>
<p>“The next is eight.
</p>
<p>“All these four hands are known as <i lang="ms">tĕrus</i>. A hand of three threes is really a good hand, being nine, but it is considered a
propitiation of good luck to throw <span class="pageNum" id="pb488">[<a href="#pb488">488</a>]</span>it down (without exposing it), and announce that one is <i lang="ms">buta</i>, in the hopes of getting good luck afterwards.
</p>
<p>“Each player makes two stakes—<i lang="ms">kapala</i> and <i lang="ms">ekor</i>. They may be of equal value, or the <i lang="ms">ekor</i> may be of greater value than the <i lang="ms">kapala</i>.
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">kapala</i> must not be of greater value than the <i lang="ms">ekor</i>; that is called <i lang="ms">tual ka ujong</i> (<i lang="ms">tual = bĕrat</i>).

</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">ekor</i> stake is only paid to the dealer if he holds one of the hands called <i lang="ms">tĕrus</i>, and if a smaller hand is held by a player, then the dealer takes both <i lang="ms">kapala</i> and <i lang="ms">ekor</i> (<i lang="ms">mengĕlong</i>).
</p>
<p>“A player who holds thirty <i>exactly</i> (except when he has three court-cards, <i lang="ms">kuda</i>) is said to be out (<i lang="ms">buta</i>).
</p>
<p>“Any one except the player on the right of the dealer may cut. The player who cuts
<i>looks at the bottom card</i> of those that he lifts, and if he thinks it is a lucky cut he accepts it and puts
down the card he has lifted (<i lang="ms">pengĕrat</i>).
</p>
<p>“The dealer then puts the rest of the pack on top of the cut, and in his turn lifts
a portion of the pack (<i lang="ms">pengangkat</i>), and looks at the bottom card.
</p>
<p>“There are all sorts of names for different cards and combinations of cards of various
degrees of luck, and these are quoted by the cutter and dealer, each declaring his
confidence in the luck coming to him by reason of the cutting or lifting of a particular
card.

<p>“A player does not hastily look at his three cards and learn his fate at once, but
he prolongs the excitement by holding his cards tight together, and looking alternately
at the outside ones, and last of all at the middle one, sliding out the latter between
the two others little by little. Thus it is left uncertain for some time whether a
card is an eight or a seven, a nine or a ten.
</p>
<p>“A man to whom a court-card, an eight, and an ace is dealt (if the eight is in the
middle), on finding that he has eleven by the two outside ones, says, for instance,
<i lang="ms">Handak kaki tiga</i>, and then commences to slide out the middle card, hoping that it is going to be an
eight, or at all events a seven (three pips on each side). This particular hand is
called <i lang="ms">lang siput</i>, because it is certain to carry off something.
</p>
<p>“A man who has just held a winning hand will say, in expressing a hope of continued
good luck, ‘<i lang="ms">Tĕman handak pisang sarabu, sudah sa-batang sa-batang pula</i>.’ (The plantain called <i lang="ms">sarabu</i> is one which puts out fruit from every stem of the <i lang="ms">perdu</i> about the same time, or one immediately after another.)”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22501src" href="#xd32e22501">173</a>

</p>
<p>The three most important card games are—(1) <i lang="ms">main sakopong</i>, (2) <i lang="ms">main chabut</i>, (3) <i lang="ms">main tiga ’lei</i>, or <i lang="ms">pakau</i>.
</p>
<p>1. In the game called <i lang="ms">sakopong</i> all cards from two to six are cast out, and five cards are dealt out to each of the
players (who may be from two to four in number); a player leads (<i lang="ms">turunkan</i>) the card, and the next player has either to follow suit (<i lang="ms">turunkan daun sagaji</i>) or throw down a card, turning it over (<i lang="ms">susupkan</i>). If the next player is able to follow suit, whoever plays the highest card of the
suit wins. If each player wins a trick it is declared drawn (<i lang="ms">s’ri</i>), and in this case all stakes are returned.
</p>
<p>2. <i lang="ms">Main chabut</i> is a species of vingt-et-un, and is played with either twenty-one or thirty-one points.
If twenty-one points only is the game, court-cards are not counted; but if the game
is thirty-one points they are also added in. Two cards are dealt by <span class="pageNum" id="pb491">[<a href="#pb491">491</a>]</span>the dealer (<i lang="ms">pĕrdi</i>) to each player, who draws (<i lang="ms">chabut</i>) fresh cards from the bottom of the pack in his turn, and gets as near as possible
to thirty-one. If he thinks he cannot safely draw another card (<i>e.g.</i> after twenty-six pips are in his hand) he “passes” (which is called <i lang="ms">b’lit kĕchil</i> if he stops at twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight, and <i lang="ms">b’lit bĕsar</i> if he stops at twenty-nine or thirty).
</p>
<p>If he obtains exactly thirty-one pips he is said to “enter the points” (<i lang="ms">masok mata</i>); but no player can draw more than seven cards, and if he has, after drawing to the
full limit, still failed to obtain as many pips as he wants, he is said to “enter
the pack” (<i lang="ms">masok daun</i>). I may add that the first two cards are called lunas or “keels,” and this may be
of various kinds, <i>e.g.</i>:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1.</span> <i lang="ms">Lunas nikah</i>, i.e. <i lang="ms">angkong dĕngan sat</i> (a court-card and an ace).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2.</span> <i lang="ms">Kachang di-rendang di-tugalkan</i>, i.e. two aces; a very convenient hand, as the aces may be reckoned as either one
or eleven, as occasion may require.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">3.</span> <i lang="ms">Lunas sa-glabat</i>, or <i lang="ms">sagaji ampat-b’las</i>, i.e. <i lang="ms">angkong dĕngan daun ampat</i> (court-card and four).</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">4.</span> <i lang="ms">Lunas dua jalor</i>, two threes.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">5.</span> Ace and two, which is the best of all.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>In playing <i lang="ms">chabut</i> or “casting out,” the tens should be thrown away (<i lang="ms">di-buang daun puloh</i>). When two players have the same number of pips—<i>e.g.</i> nine and nine or eight and eight—the coincidence is described in the words, <i lang="ms">Jumpa di jalan, di-adu, kalah, di-chabut, mati</i>. To be “bluffed” is called <i lang="ms">kĕna ranjau</i> (wounded by a caltrop).
</p>
<p>And again, when a player has obtained, let us say, twenty-six pips with six cards,
and so has only one more chance, and is afraid to risk it, his position is <span class="pageNum" id="pb492">[<a href="#pb492">492</a>]</span>ridiculed in the phrase, <i lang="ms">Sa-nepak Ulu Klang</i>, a jest of obviously local coinage.
</p>
<p>The phrase <i lang="ms">Tĕngah tiang</i> (half mast), again, is applied to twenty-five pips held irrespective of the number
of cards; and if more than thirty-one are obtained, the player is said to be out (<i lang="ms">mati</i>, or <i lang="ms">masok piring</i>).
</p>
<p>3. <i lang="ms">Daun tiga ’lei</i> or <i lang="ms">Pakau</i> is played here as follows:—
</p>
<p>Three cards are dealt by the dealer to each player, and the winner is he who holds
the greatest number of pips, with certain exceptions.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>A hand of three threes, it will be observed, is the second best hand in Selangor,
whereas in Perak, according to Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell, it is thrown away as the worst.
</p>
<p>The stakes, which are deposited in two heaps by each player, are here called <i lang="ms">kapala</i> or “head,” and <i lang="ms">buntut</i> (or <i lang="ms">ekor</i>), the “tail,” respectively; the <i lang="ms">kapala</i> being generally, though perhaps not always, greater than the <i lang="ms">ekor</i> in Selangor, instead of the reverse. The latter can only be lost when a player sweeps
the board. A single stake, again, is <i lang="ms">podul</i> (or occasionally <i lang="ms">tual</i>), but <i lang="ms">bĕrtuwi</i> is applied to betting between players, and <i lang="ms">sorong</i> or <i lang="ms">tokong</i> means to put down a stake before your rival replies with a counter-stake <span class="pageNum" id="pb493">[<a href="#pb493">493</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">bĕrteban</i> or <i lang="ms">topah</i>). A player who holds thirty exactly is not out here—<i>e.g.</i>, he may hold a court-card and two tens. To look at the bottom card is <i lang="ms">mĕnengo’ angkatan</i>.
</p>
<p>Sir W.&nbsp;E. Maxwell gives a number of names and phrases applied to particular cards
and combinations of cards, to which I may add—
</p>
<ul>
<li>Two nines and a two—<i lang="ms">China Keh mĕngandar ayer</i>.</li>
<li>An eight and an ace (making nine) with a court-card, or a ten and two nines—<i lang="ms">Sĕmbilang bĕrtĕlor</i>.</li>
<li>Two court-cards and a nine—<i lang="ms">Parak hari ’nak siang</i>.</li>
<li>The four of any suit—<i lang="ms">Tiang jamban Lĕbai ʿAli</i>.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>The explanation of <i lang="ms">handak kaki tiga</i>, as applied to an eight, appears to be that the eight has three pips on each side.
It is also called <i lang="ms">bĕrisi sa-b’lah</i>. <i lang="ms">Minta’ pĕnoh</i> (I ask for a full one) means I want a nine (?), and <i lang="ms">minta’ tombak</i> (I ask for a lance), I want two pips (or three, as the case may be).
</p>
<p>Besides the above, there are miniature or bijou cards (<i lang="ms">chĕki</i>)—e.g. <i lang="ms">chĕki dua-b’las</i>, <i lang="ms">chĕki lima-b’las</i> and <i lang="ms">’tan</i> or <i lang="ms">bĕrĕtan daun sambilan</i>, etc., the <i lang="ms">daun chĕki</i> being distinguished by their borders, e.g. <i lang="ms">iyu kuching</i>, <i lang="ms">iyu nyonya</i>, <i lang="ms">iyu panjang</i>, <i lang="ms">iyu mĕrak besar</i>, <i lang="ms">iyu kasut</i>; and again <i lang="ms">gapet</i>, <i lang="ms">gapet k’rang</i>, <i lang="ms">gapet rintek</i>, <i lang="ms">gapet lichin</i>; <i lang="ms">babi</i>, <i lang="ms">babi rintek</i>, <i lang="ms">babi pusat</i>, <i lang="ms">babi lichin</i>; <i lang="ms">kau merah</i>, <i lang="ms">kau bulat</i>, <i lang="ms">kau lichin</i>; <i lang="ms">layer</i>, <i lang="ms">layer rintek</i>, <i lang="ms">layer pitis</i>, <i lang="ms">layer lichin</i>. Six to seven people play these games. A sort of whist is also played from time to
time under the name of <i lang="ms">main trup</i>. At this game a trick is called <i lang="ms">sapudi</i>; to sweep the board is <i lang="ms">pukol tani</i>; and the players who get no tricks at all are said to be sold up (<i lang="ms">kĕna kot</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23052src" href="#xd32e23052">174</a>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Children’s Games</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I will now give some specimens of the games I have seen played by children:—
</p>
<p>“Throwing the Flower across” (<i lang="ms">champak bunga sa-b’lah</i>) is a game which I have seen thus played by boys.
</p>
<p>A handkerchief was twisted up (like a rope) from corner to corner, folded in half,
and then tied together at the ends.
</p>
<p>Two couples stood facing one another at a few yards’ distance, and at a given signal
one of the boys in each couple took his companion up on to his shoulders. The two
who were mounted threw the handkerchief across to each other, and back again by turns.
When the one failed to catch it, both riders dismounted and offered backs to their
late “mounts,” who thus became riders, and threw the handkerchief in their turn. Each
time, however, that a catch was made both parties crossed over. When three catches
were made in unbroken succession (<i lang="ms">kĕlerik</i>) the riders had the privilege of being carried across three times before recommencing
play.
</p>
<p>I should add that a coin was tossed up at the outset of the game to decide who were
to start as the riders, and who were to be the ridden.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Main Sesel</i> (or <i lang="ms">Kachau kueh</i>) bears a strong family resemblance to our own “Hen and chickens.” When I witnessed
it, a big boy played the “Paterfamilias” with a string of children at his back, each
of whom was holding on to the one in front of him. Presently a “Cakeseller” presented
himself, and the following conversation ensued:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb495">[<a href="#pb495">495</a>]</span>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Paterfamilias</span>: <i lang="ms">Ada kueh?</i> (Have you any cake?)
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cakeseller</span>: <i lang="ms">Ada.</i> (I have.)
</p>
<p></p>
<p>P.F.: <i lang="ms">Buleh aku b’li?</i> (Can I buy some?)
</p>
<p></p>
<p>C.: <i lang="ms">Buleh.</i> (Yes.)</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Here the Cakeseller hands a ball of earth to Paterfamilias, who passes it down the
line of children to the youngest child at the end of the row. The conversation then
recommenced—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Cakeseller</span>: <i lang="ms">Aku minta’ duit.</i> (I want my money.)
</p>
<p>P.F.: <i lang="ms">Duit t’ada, anak kunchi tinggal di jamban.</i> (I have got no money, I have mislaid the key.) <i lang="ms">Kalau mahu ambil budak, ambil yang di-b’lakang.</i> (If you wish to take one of my children, take the last.)</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Here a desperate effort was made by the poor Cakeseller to dodge past Paterfamilias
and get at the boy, whom he eventually succeeded in carrying off.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Main Tul</i> is a game somewhat resembling our own “Puss in the corner,” but with only one “home.”
The “home” consisted of a stake planted upright, and the first “Puss” (<i lang="ms">orang tul</i>) was selected by a species of divination depending upon repetition of the same formula
as is used to select the blind man in Blind Man’s Buff (<i lang="ms">Main China Buta</i>). There was (as I have said) only one home in this game, from which the players sallied
forth to taunt the <i lang="ms">orang tul</i>, and which they were obliged to touch in order to save themselves when closely pursued.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Main Sĕladang</i> (Wild Bull game) is an excellent game for children with the shoeless feet of the
East. A “wild bull” having been selected by repetition of the <i lang="ms">Ping hilang</i> formula, went upon all fours, and entered into the following conversation between
himself and one of the other players specially selected for the purpose. The latter
opened negotiations with the clearly non-committal, if not very lucid remark, “<i lang="ms">Tam <span class="pageNum" id="pb496">[<a href="#pb496">496</a>]</span>tam kul</i>” to which the “Bull” replied, “<i lang="ms">Buat apa guna bakul</i>” (What are you going to do with your basket?)
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Boy</span>: <i lang="ms">Mĕngisi arang</i>. (To hold charcoal.)
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bull</span>: <i lang="ms">Buat apa guna arang?</i> (What will you do with the charcoal?)
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Boy</span>: <i lang="ms">Mĕnĕmpa</i> (or <i lang="ms">masak</i>) <i lang="ms">lĕmbing</i>. (I shall forge a spear.)
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bull</span>: <i lang="ms">Buat apa guna lĕmbing?</i> (What use will you make of the spear?)
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Boy</span>: <i lang="ms">Mĕnikam sĕladang</i>. (To stab a bull with.)
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bull</span> (who is getting excited): <i lang="ms">Buat apa guna di-tikam?</i> (What use will it be to stab him?)
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Boy</span>: <i lang="ms">Mĕngambil hati-nya</i>. (To get his heart.)
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bull</span> (who is now fairly savage): <i lang="ms">Buat apa guna hati-nya?</i> (What use will you make of his heart?)
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Boy</span>: <i lang="ms">Buat santap Raja Muda</i>. (Get the Crown Prince to partake (of it).)</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The Bull at the end of this baiting was ready to “charge” anybody and everything,
and did accordingly run at the rest of the players, kicking out with all his might
at anybody who came near. As he had to move on all fours he could not go very fast,
and the other players took advantage of this to bait him still further by slapping
him on the back and jumping over him. Whenever they came near enough he lashed out
with his heels, and when he succeeded in kicking another player below the knee, the
latter became a Bull in his turn. Much agility is displayed in this game, which is
thoroughly enjoyed by the players.
</p>
<p>“Blind Man’s Buff” (<i lang="ms">Main China Buta</i>, or “Blind Chinaman”) is played in exactly the same manner as our own Blind Man’s
Buff; one of the party, with bandaged eyes, being required to catch any one who comes
near him.
</p>
<p>The first blind man—at the commencement of the game—is chosen as follows: the intending
players sit down together in a close circle, each of them putting down the tips of
their forefingers in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb497">[<a href="#pb497">497</a>]</span>centre of the circle; then somebody who is not playing taps each of them on the head
in turn, repeating at each tap a word of the following formula:—

<p>The “fruit” (or piece of wood, as the case may be) was left in the palm of one of
the boys, and as soon as the reciter came to the end of the rhyme the boy with the
token had to jump out of the ranks before he was stopped by the boys on each side
of him, each of whom suddenly stretched out his legs for the purpose of tripping up
the runaway. When they touched him he lost his turn, but if he succeeded in getting
clear without being touched he obtained the privilege of going to the other end of
the ground and calling any boy he chose out of the ranks to carry him back again,
at the invitation of the late spokesman. On his return he was stopped in front of
the ranks with the challenge:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">In reply to this last question the pass (<i>i.e.</i> the fruit or piece of wood) was shown and both boys rejoined the ranks, whereupon
the game recommenced <i>da capo</i>.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Hantu Musang</i> or “The Pole-cat Fiend,” is a game in which a boy sits down (between two others)
with a cloth thrown over his head, the ends of which are twisted up (like rope ends)
by the two boys on <span class="pageNum" id="pb499">[<a href="#pb499">499</a>]</span>each side of him; the cloth fits his head like a cap, with a long end at the back
and in front. First the boy in front pulls his end of the cloth and then the boy at
the back pulls his end, thus causing the boy between them to rock to and fro. This
treatment is continued for some time while they repeat the following rhyme:—

<p>As soon as this rhyme is finished the two outside boys make off as fast as they can,
pursued by the “pole-cat,” who is allowed to give a really good bite (in the arm)
to the first person he overtakes.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Main Tunggul.</i>—This game I saw played with four boys a side. A boy was selected to represent the
<i lang="ms">tunggul</i> or stump, and took up his position at a little distance (about half-way between the
two parties as they stood facing each other a few yards apart). Up to the stump (<i lang="ms">tunggul</i>) a boy from each of the sides alternately ran and whispered the name of a boy belonging
to the opposite party. This whispering was continued until the names of the two boys
selected happened to agree, the <i lang="ms">tunggul</i> then making a gesture, at which the boys of one of the sides crossed over and carried
back on their shoulders the boys belonging to the opposite side.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Kuching</i> (the Cat Game) was a mere guessing game. The “guesser,” or witness (<i lang="ms">saksi</i>), stood at <span class="pageNum" id="pb500">[<a href="#pb500">500</a>]</span>a little distance with his face turned away whilst another boy was selected to play
“puss,” and yet another boy was permitted to twitch him on the ear or wherever else
he might prefer. Then the “witness” was told to turn round, and going up to the “cat”
he made his guess.
</p>
<p><i lang="ms">Sorok-sorok</i> is merely the Malay equivalent of our hide-and-seek, with the exception that whereas
hide-and-seek may be played by day as well as by night, the game of <i lang="ms">sorok-sorok</i> should properly be played at night alone.

</p>
<p>(2) <i lang="ms">Chimplek</i>, which is a sort of “heads and tails” game; “heads” being called <i lang="ms">chaping</i>, and “tails” <i lang="ms">sim</i>.
</p>
<p>(3) <i lang="ms">Porok</i>, which consists in kicking (with the side of the foot) a small cocoa-nut shell, with
the object of hitting a similar shell a few yards off.
</p>
<p>This game appears to be identical with what is called <i lang="ms">main gayau</i> in Selangor, in which, however, a fruit or seed called <i lang="ms">buah gandu</i> is substituted for the cocoa-nut shell and propelled by the big toe of the player’s
foot.
</p>
<p>(4) <i lang="ms">Main sĕremban</i>, which is played with cockle-shells by two girls at a time, each player taking twenty
cockle-shells (<i lang="ms">kulit k’rang</i>) into her lap. Each player in turn has to toss up one of the cockle-shells and catch,
simultaneously snatching a fresh shell from the heap. If the girl who is playing fails
in either task, she loses to her opponent.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">10.</span> THEATRICAL EXHIBITIONS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Malay Drama, taking the word in its widest sense as comprising every kind of theatrical
exhibition, includes performances of several different types, which derive their origin
from various distinct sources. Most of them bear some traces of their foreign extraction,
and though they have been much modified by the Malays, and are now quite “naturalised”
in the Peninsula, it is pretty clear that the greater part have been borrowed from
India, Siam, China, and possibly other countries. It is noteworthy that many, perhaps
most, of the plots represented in these performances <span class="pageNum" id="pb504">[<a href="#pb504">504</a>]</span>owe their origin to the old classical Indian Epics, and especially to the story of
the Ramayana, which has been handed down traditionally, much modified by local colouring,
in Java and Siam as well as in the Malay Peninsula.
</p>
<p>It is not within the scope of this work to give anything like a full description of
these different kinds of dramatic representations, but it is desirable to give some
account of the ritual which accompanies them, and the ideas and superstitions which
they seem to involve.
</p>
<p>The most important of the ceremonies which relate to the Malay theatre is that of
inaugurating or “opening” (as it is called) a site for the performance. The following
is an account (by Mr. Hugh Clifford) of the performance of this ceremony:—
</p>
<p>“When one of these companies arrives at a place where it intends to ‘open,’ it erects
a small, square shed, open at all four sides, but carefully roofed in, and with a
hand-rail running round it about two feet from the ground. This shed is called a <i lang="ms">Bangsal</i>, and the space which its sides enclose is termed <i lang="ms">Panggong</i>. Before the play begins, the ceremony called <i lang="ms">Bûka Panggong</i>, which has for its object the invocation and propitiation of certain spirits, is

<p>“The ceremony, which is a curious one, is performed in the following manner: The company
having entered the shed and taken their seats, a brazier is placed in front of the
<i lang="ms">Pâwang</i>, or Medicine-Man, who is also the head of the theatrical troop. In this brazier precious
woods and spices are burned, and while the incense ascends, the <i lang="ms">Pâwang</i> intones the following incantation, the other members of the troop repeating each
sentence in chorus as he concludes it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb505">[<a href="#pb505">505</a>]</span></p>
<p>“ ‘Peace be unto Thee, whose mother is from the earth, and whose father has ascended
to the Heavens! Smite not the male and female actors, and the old and young buffoons
with Thy cruelty, nor yet with the curse of poverty! Oh, do not threaten with punishment
the members of this company, for I come not hither to vie with Thee in wisdom or skill
or talent: not such is my desire in coming hither. If I come unto this place, I do
so placing my faith in all the people,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24108src" href="#xd32e24108">180</a> my masters who own this village. Therefore suffer not any one to oppress, or envy,

paces from the four corners of our shed, and that Thou shalt refrain from wandering
hither and thither, for under Thy care I place the male and female actors, and all
the buffoons, both young and old, together with all the musicians and the bridegrooms.
I place them under Thy care, and do not oppress or envy them, neither suffer evil
to befall them, do not strike against them as Thou passest by. I place them under
Thy charge, together with the actors and actresses, the musicians and bridegrooms,
the buffoons, both young and old, also the spectators and the owners of this house
and compound; suffer them not to be afflicted with headaches, throbbing pains, nor
yet with shooting pains, nor yet with toothache, nor with itchings and skin irritations,
nor with burning <span class="pageNum" id="pb507">[<a href="#pb507">507</a>]</span>sensations; for I pray that they may be suffered to get cool and refreshed like unto
the snake, the <i lang="ms">chinta-mâni</i>.’
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">Pâwang</i> here scatters parched rice stained with saffron in every direction, and chants the
following incantation the while: ʿPeace be unto thee! I am about to move from within
this enclosure four paces in each direction of the four corners of the universe. O
ye Holy Ones who are present in this place, within the space of these four paces towards
the four extremities of the universe, be not startled nor deranged, do not remove
to a distance, and be not angry or wrathful, for thy servant cometh not hither to
vie with ye in wisdom within this thy territory and village. Your servant cometh to
satisfy the desires of all the people who own this place, and your servant desires
to abandon himself unto ye, his guardians, the Holy Ones of this place, and thus presuming
he asks pardon of ye, and would commend to your care himself, and the actors and actresses,
O Grandsires, ye Holy Ones of this place; and in like manner would he commend unto
ye the musicians and the bridegrooms, the buffoons, both old and young; and he prays
ye not to show envy towards them, nor yet to oppress them, nor do them any injury;
suffer them not to be destroyed or injured; and he entreats thee, his Grandsires,
and all your many imps, to refrain from striking against them as ye pass by them,
neither to address them, nor to pinch or nip them, and let not your youths, O Grandsires,
remove our means of livelihood; and your servant prays ye to refrain from destroying
or damaging, injuring or hurting the whole company of the <i lang="ms">ma’iong</i>, and suffer them to be cool and refreshed like unto the snake, the <i lang="ms">chinta-mâni</i>.

<p>“ ‘Peace be unto Thee! I am about to remove from thee my Grandsire who art styled
Pĕtĕra Gûru, the original teacher, who art from the beginning, and who art incarnate
from thy birth. Teacher who dwellest as a hermit in the recesses of the Moon, and
who practisest thy magic arts in the womb of the Sun; teacher of mine whose coat is
wrought of green beads, whose blood is white, who hast stumps for bones, the hairs

the buffoons both young and old! And I pray thee, O Grandsire, to stretch forth thy
feet—the feet at which I prostrate myself; and thy hands—the hands which I take in
salutation. And I beg from thee, O Grandsire, the white charm (antidote), the <i lang="ms">mĕdong bĕr-sîla</i>; cause to descend upon me three drops thereof together with thy magic, O Grandsire;

I pray thee not to suffer them to be injured, maimed, or battered. And now I will
arouse all the actors and actresses from within the seven Chambers of the seven Palaces,
the seven Pavilions—the Palaces which are on high, the Palaces which were from the

Longing and Supreme Desire. The Longing which lasts from Dawn unto Dawn, which causes
food to cease to satisfy, and renders sleep uneasy, which remembering causes to remember
unceasingly, hearing to hear, seeing to see! I will awake all from the exterior even
unto the inner Chambers of the seven Apartments of the seven Palaces! remain not plunged
in slumber, but awake! One and all awake and hear my tidings and my words! Awake and

this company of actors and actresses, all this company of players who sit within this

</p>
<p>“When this incantation is finished the player, whose turn it is to begin the performance,
prostrates himself before the <i lang="ms">Hĕrbab</i>, or large Malay fiddle, washes his <span class="pageNum" id="pb510">[<a href="#pb510">510</a>]</span>face in some imaginary essence which the gong is supposed to contain, and then arises
and begins to act his part.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24267src" href="#xd32e24267">189</a>
</p>
<p>A similar ceremony was witnessed in 1897 by Mr. Everard Fielding and the present writer
at the back of the Bungalow at Jugra (in Selangor). The object of the ceremony was
to drive away evil spirits from the spot where the performance was to take place,
and the performers were a little band of players from Penang who had settled in the
neighbourhood and had planted their holdings with Liberian coffee.
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> or magician in this instance was a Malay named ’Che Hussein, who acted as clown,
and subsequently wrote out at my request rough transcripts of more than a dozen of
the plays acted by his company.
</p>
<p>A big mat or mats having been laid upon the ground in a spot carefully selected for
the purpose, four corner posts were planted and a big awning or ceiling-cloth (<i lang="ms">langit-langit</i>) stretched between them. The square space between the posts was then fenced off by
carrying a couple of cords round it horizontally from post to post, one at the height
of two, and the other about five feet above the ground. From these cords were suspended
various ornamental objects made of plaited strips of cocoa-nut leaf, fashioned into
rough resemblances of animals, birds, fruit and flowers, a few bananas being added
at intervals, these latter serving as light refreshments for the players whenever
they felt so minded. Stems of banana trees with their leaves fastened at each post
made the structure complete, and the general effect, enhanced by the bright <span class="pageNum" id="pb511">[<a href="#pb511">511</a>]</span>costumes of the performers, was extremely picturesque, and, as it was intended to
be, extremely rural.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24284src" href="#xd32e24284">190</a>
</p>
<p>A tray with the usual brazier of incense and small bowls of rice variously prepared
was then brought in, and all the instruments, though not necessarily the players,
being in their places, the ceremony commenced as follows:—
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure floatRight fig5width" id="fig5"><img src="images/fig05.png" alt="Fig. 5.—Tapers used in exorcising evil spirits." width="123" height="120"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Fig. 5.</span>—Tapers used in exorcising evil spirits.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>First came the <i lang="ms">Lagu Pĕmanggil</i>, or Invocation, a peculiar air performed on the instruments and accompanied by the
<i lang="ms">Pawang</i>. The latter heaped incense on a brazier in front of him, and “waved” in the incense
first the fiddle (<i lang="ms">rĕbab</i>) and then the masks, wooden daggers, and other “properties” of the company, until
they were well fumigated. He next lighted three tapers, which he charmed and took
between the closed palms of his hands (held in front of him), with the fingers straight
and the thumbs crossed. He then proceeded to “wave” these tapers, pointing them first
to the right, then in front of him, and finally to the left, and then distributed
the tapers, putting the first on the <i lang="ms">rĕbab</i>, and the second on the big gong, and the third on the edge of a brazen ring in front
of the place where he is sitting. He now reached for the betel-leaf box (which should
be close by), and dipping the tip of his finger into the moist lime which it contained,
smeared the metal all round with it, and <i>made the sign of the cross inside the ring</i>. Next he shrouded his head with a black cloth, and taking a handful of rice in his
closed fist held it in the incense, sprinkled some of it over the <span class="pageNum" id="pb512">[<a href="#pb512">512</a>]</span>brazier and “charmed” it, holding it close to his mouth. Then he suddenly scattered
it first to the right, then in front, and lastly to the left, the scattering being
in each case accompanied by a single boom of the big gong.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure floatLeft fig6width" id="fig6"><img src="images/fig06.png" alt="Fig. 6.—Taper fixed on brazen ring used in same ceremony." width="156" height="268"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Fig. 6.</span>—Taper fixed on brazen ring used in same ceremony.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>The distribution of the rice being completed, he took four “chews” of betel and handed
one to each of the two drummers (<i lang="ms">juru-gĕndang</i>); the third he threw on to the top of the ceiling-cloth (or roof in the case of a
shed, <i lang="ms">bumbong bangsal</i>), and the fourth he buried underneath the bottom mat.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24332src" href="#xd32e24332">191</a> With his head still shrouded he now placed the tip of his right thumb within the
metal ring, in the very centre of the cross, called the Heart of the Earth (<i lang="ms">pusat bumi</i> or <i lang="ms">hati tanah</i>), and pressing downwards with it, worked it round to the left and back again repeatedly
whilst he recited the necessary charm. After this he leaned in turn on the upper end
of each of the drums, which he inclined over the brazier and “charmed,” concluding
in each case with three loud taps on the drum which he was “charming,” each tap being
accompanied by similar taps on the other two drums. Finally, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> put the flageolet (<i lang="ms">sĕrunei</i>) to his lips, and the other instruments accompanied him in the performance of the
tune called <i lang="ms">taboh</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24357src" href="#xd32e24357">192</a>
</p>
<p>As has already been observed, the performances at these theatrical exhibitions are
of several distinct <span class="pageNum" id="pb513">[<a href="#pb513">513</a>]</span>kinds, and vary considerably in different places. The <i lang="ms">Joget</i>, a kind of dramatic and symbolical dance, has been described under the head of Dances.
The <i lang="ms">Ma’yong</i> is a theatrical performance which includes both dancing (or posturing as Europeans
would be tempted to call it) and singing. It is generally performed by travelling
companies of professional actors and actresses, who go on tour and perform either
at the houses of Rajas or other persons of some social standing, or before the general
public in some public place.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24374src" href="#xd32e24374">193</a> Just as the dances of the <i lang="ms">Joget</i> are supposed to be symbolical of different actions and ideas, and are accompanied
by appropriate music, so in the <i lang="ms">Ma’yong</i> there is quite a long list of tunes, each of which is considered to be appropriate
to a particular action, or to some one or more of the <i lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>. In fact, one may almost say that we have here, in principle, the rude germ of the
Wagnerian <i lang="de">Leitmotif</i>. Thus when one of the performers is supposed to be sent to sleep, the <i lang="ms">Lagu Lĕgor Radin</i> is the one used; in the representation of a death, the <i lang="ms">Lagu Mĕrayu</i>; when a character is supposed to be entering the jungle, the <i lang="ms">Lagu Samsam</i>; when any one sits down, the <i lang="ms">Lagu Patani Tuah</i>. Similarly the <i lang="ms">Lagu Puyuh</i>, the <i lang="ms">Lagu Dang Dondang Lanjut Kĕdah</i>, and the <i lang="ms">Lagu Sendayong Dualapis Pŭtri</i> are appropriated to the Princess (<i lang="ms">Pŭtri</i>), one of the stock characters of this species of play, while other tunes can be used
only by the Princess and the Raja or principal male character (<i lang="ms">Pa’yong</i>); and others, again, are employed indifferently to accompany any of the parts, whether
prince, princess, clown (<i lang="ms">P’ran</i>), or maid (<i lang="ms">Inang</i>).
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure plate21width" id="plate21"><img src="images/plate21.jpg" alt="Plate 21.—Masks of Clowns and Demon." width="583" height="375"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Plate 21.—Masks of Clowns and Demon.</span></p>
<p class="first">Theatrical masks used by Malay strolling players. The two masks at each end are worn
by the clowns (<i lang="ms">pran</i>), and cover the upper jaw only, the eyes being mother-of-pearl with hollow pupils.
The central mask represents a forest demon (<i lang="ms">hantu rimba</i>).
</p>
<p><i>Page 513.</i></p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb514">[<a href="#pb514">514</a>]</span></p>
<p>The costumes of the performers in the various kinds of dramatic exhibitions vary,
of course, with the subject-matter of the representation. The clown’s masks and the
forest demon (<i lang="ms">hantu hutan</i>), of which illustrations are given, will serve as specimens to indicate the nature
of some of the accessories in use. A fairly full list of their Malay names will be
found in the classification given below.
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">Ma’yong</i> is perhaps the most typical form of Malay theatrical representations, but another
very characteristic performance is the Shadow-Play, properly termed <i lang="ms">Wayang</i>, a name that has been loosely extended to cover theatrical exhibitions in general.
</p>
<p>“The show is called <i lang="ms">Wayang Kulit</i>, or leather puppets. It is exhibited in a rough shed, which has a flooring raised
about three feet from the ground; the building is usually twenty feet square and enclosed
on three sides, the front alone being open; across this opening a white sheet is stretched
on which the shadows of the puppets are thrown and seen through by the audience; the
latter sit or stand in the open air.
</p>
<p></p>

<p class="first">Magic flying horse (<i lang="ms">kuda sĕmbrani</i>) used in the shadow-play by ’Che ʿAbas. It is said to be able to swim through the
water as well as to fly through the air.
</p>
<p><i>Page 514.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“The show seems to be of Hindu origin, if we may judge from the strong resemblance
the figures bear to the representations of gods and goddesses worshipped by the Hindus
of India; it is probably obtained from Java.
</p>
<p>“The figures are made of buffalo hide, and the arms alone are movable; they are moved
by slips of wood attached to them, which are very clumsily contrived, and as their
shadows are seen with the puppets the effect is very much destroyed. Various scenes
of a domestic nature are exhibited, and they take the shape of a play, but with no
definite <span class="pageNum" id="pb515">[<a href="#pb515">515</a>]</span>plot running through or connecting the different scenes.
</p>
<p>“The following is a specimen:—
</p>
<p>“An old man appears weeping for a long-lost son, and moves to and fro for some time
bewailing his loss; the showman speaks each figure’s part, and alters the tone of
his voice to suit the age of the speaker; a second figure comes on, representing a
young man armed with a <i lang="ms">kris</i>, who endeavours to pick a quarrel with the first comer, and the conversation is witty
and characteristic, eliciting roars of laughter from the lookers-on; a fight ensues,
and the old man is wounded; he falls and cries out that were he a young man, or if
his lost son were present, his adversary should not thus triumph over him. In his
conversation he happens to mention his son’s name; the young man intimates that his
name is the same, an explanation ensues, and it ends by the old man discovering in
his late adversary his long-lost son. The old fellow weeps and laughs alternately,
caresses his son frequently, and declares they shall never part again; the scene ends
by the youth shedding tears over his late inhuman conduct, and he finally walks off
with the old gentleman on his back.
</p>
<p>“The conversation is carried on solely in the Malayan dialect. Warlike scenes please
most: a warrior comes on the stage and challenges his invisible enemy to mortal combat;
suddenly another figure comes on at the opposite side and a desperate fight ensues,
which lasts for a very long time, and ends in one of the combatants being killed.
Occasionally a battle in which ten or twelve figures join takes place, and for hours
will the Malays look on at such scenes.
</p>
<p>“The show concludes with an exhibition of various <span class="pageNum" id="pb516">[<a href="#pb516">516</a>]</span>animals—deer, horses, tigers, crocodiles, etc., also birds and fishes. The figures
are perforated to represent the eyes, shape of the dress, etc.
</p>
<p>“At the back of the shed, concealed by the sheet, sit the musicians, who keep up an
incessant din on drums and cymbals.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24494src" href="#xd32e24494">194</a>

</p>
<p>The puppets for these shadow-plays are usually cut out of deer-skin (not buffalo hide)
and it is worth remarking that they are all considered to be more or less animated;
a stringent propitiatory ceremony has to be performed in their honour, incense being
burnt and rice scattered about, just as in the <i lang="ms">Ma’yong</i> ceremony already described.
</p>
<p>The present writer, while in Selangor, bought from a Kelantan Malay named ’Che ʿAbas,
a performer of shadow-plays, his entire stock-in-trade, including not only his musical
instruments (amongst which were some curious drums called <i lang="ms">gĕdu</i> and <i lang="ms">gĕdombak</i>), but also his candle (with its shade), the rice used for the ceremony, and his entire
stock of shadow-pictures, all of which are now in the Cambridge Museum.
</p>
<p>The following classification of the more important kinds of theatrical performances,
which was drawn up for the present writer by ’Che Hussein of Penang, the actor of
whom mention has already been made, may be of interest, and will serve to indicate
briefly their several characteristic features, though it does not profess to be absolutely
exhaustive:—

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">11.</span> <span class="sc">WAR AND WEAPONS</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Such charms as might be used in time of war, or in case of danger from wild beasts
or other enemies, are partly what may be called “defensive” and partly “offensive”
in character.
</p>
<p>The Malays who use them pray, on the one hand, for a supernatural appearance wherewith
to scare their enemies and protect themselves, and on the other for supernatural powers
to assist in the destruction of their foes.
</p>
<p>Thus, one of their charms runs:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Let me face the Seven Suns,
</p>
<p class="line">But let not my enemies face me.
</p>
<p class="line">Ha! I am a Tiger and thou art a Dog.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24949src" href="#xd32e24949">195</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The use of such charms is supplemented in various ways: thus a champion (<i lang="ms">pĕnglima</i>) will sometimes draw a line in front of him, which he believes his enemy will be
unable to pass;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24960src" href="#xd32e24960">196</a> this is done by simply scraping the ground with the right foot and threatening the
foe with a dire curse if he attempts to cross it.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Push and you die, step across and your leg shall break.
</p>
<p class="line">I apply the charm of the Line called the Swollen Corpse.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">According to another method of gaining martial vigour and immunity in fighting, you
take a wick as long as the short span between your thumb and first finger (<i lang="ms">sa-jĕngkal tĕlunjok</i>), and after passing it over your body upwards (<i lang="ms">di-naikkan</i>) thrice, take it between your two hands and try and turn it round while you repeat
the charm. The ceremony must take place at <span class="pageNum" id="pb523">[<a href="#pb523">523</a>]</span>the time of full moon, and if you do not succeed in turning it the first time, you
can try again at the next full moon, and so on up to three full moons. At night, if
you succeed you will (according to the Malay account) see the vision of a man, a sign,
it is to be supposed, that the charm has been effectual, and that the prayer has been
heard.
</p>
<p>The charm begins as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate!
</p>
<p class="line">May this nerve of stone pierce stone,
</p>
<p class="line">Pierce stone and split stone,
</p>
<p class="line">Pierce planks and go right through them,
</p>
<p class="line">Pierce water and dry it up,
</p>
<p class="line">Pierce the earth and make a hole in it,
</p>
<p class="line">Pierce the grass and wither it,
</p>
<p class="line">Pierce mountains and cause them to fall,
</p>
<p class="line">Pierce the heavens that they may fall,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The charm concludes with the following magnificent boast:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Of Iron am I, and of Copper is my frame,
</p>
<p class="line">And my name is ‘Tiger of God.’ ”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In a somewhat similar charm, a warrior prays that he may be
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Fenced with Hell-fire up to the eyes;”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and another expresses the wish that his enemies may be
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ground to powder like tin-ore after washing.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In actual warfare a number of rules are laid down, the observance of which is supposed
to be necessary in order to achieve success. As in several other pursuits,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25004src" href="#xd32e25004">197</a> there is, of course, a “taboo” language of war (<i lang="ms">bhasa pantang p’rang</i>), of which the following are examples:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb524">[<a href="#pb524">524</a>]</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dagger (<i lang="ms">k’ris</i>) = <i lang="ms">pisau</i> (lit. knife).</li>
<li>Bullet (<i lang="ms">pĕluru sĕnapang</i>) = <i lang="ms">kumbang puteh</i> (lit. white beetle).</li>
<li>Ball of swivel-gun (<i lang="ms">pĕluru lela</i>) = <i lang="ms">kumbang hitam</i> (lit. black beetle).</li>
<li>Stockade (<i lang="ms">kubu</i>) = <i lang="ms">batang mĕlintang</i> (lit. transverse trunk), or <i lang="ms">balei mĕlintang</i>.</li>
<li>Cannon (<i lang="ms">mĕriam</i>) = <i lang="ms">batang kabu-kabu</i> (lit. cotton-tree trunk), or <i lang="ms">batang buloh</i> (lit. trunk of bamboo).</li>
<li>Cannon-ball = <i lang="ms">buah niyor</i> (lit. cocoa-nut).</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>When a man is out in the wars his pillows and sleeping-mat at home have to be kept
rolled up. If any one else were to use them the absent warrior’s courage would fail,
and disaster would befall him (<i lang="ms">tĕr-tentu-lah kachau hati tuan-nya yang di p’rang itu, datang-lah mara</i>). His wife and children must not have their hair cut (<i lang="ms">ta’ buleh potong rambut atau bĕrandam</i>) during his absence, nor may he himself. Strict chastity must be observed in a stockade,
or the bullets of the garrison will lose their power (<i lang="ms">pĕluru jinak di kubu-nya</i>), and it is also forbidden to abuse or mock at the enemy, or even at their weapons.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25079src" href="#xd32e25079">198</a>
</p>
<p>Bullets are frequently, if not always, “charmed” before being used, and their efficacy
is supposed to be increased thereby. The Orang Kaya Pahlawan, a chief of some local
notoriety in recent times, claimed to be invulnerable (<i lang="ms">kĕbal</i>) to the extent that nothing but a <i>silver</i> bullet would hurt him.
</p>
<p>The following legendary tale illustrates a somewhat similar idea:—The assailant, one
Magat Terawis, an unknown warrior who had joined the Sultan’s investing army, had
four bullets, on each of which were inscribed the words: “This is the son of the concubine
of the Raja of Pagar-ruyong; his name is Magat Terawis; wherever his bullet falls
he will become a Chief.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb525">[<a href="#pb525">525</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Magat Terawis levelled his matchlock and fired, and his bullet struck Tan Saban’s
leg. The skin was hardly broken, and the bullet fell to the ground at the chief’s
feet; but, on taking it up and reading the inscription, he knew that he had received
his death-wound. He retired to his house, and, after ordering his flag to be hauled
down, despatched a messenger to the opposite camp to call the warrior whose name he
had read on the bullet. Inquiries for Magat Terawis were fruitless at first, for no
one knew the name. At length he declared himself, and went across the river with Tan
Saban’s messenger, who brought him into the presence of the dying man. The latter
said to him, ‘Magat Terawis, thou art my son in this world and the next, and my property
is thine. I likewise give thee my daughter in marriage, and do thou serve the Raja
faithfully in my place, and not be rebellious as I have been.’ Tan Saban then sued
for the Sultan’s pardon, which was granted to him, and the marriage of his daughter
with Magat Terawis was permitted to take place. Then Tan Saban died, and was buried
with all the honours due to a Malay chief.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25102src" href="#xd32e25102">199</a>
</p>
<p>The national and favourite weapon of the Malays is the <i lang="ms">k’ris</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25112src" href="#xd32e25112">200</a> a short dagger usually with an undulating or wavy blade set in a handle of peculiarly
carved pattern, as to the probable origin of which some allusion has already been
made,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25121src" href="#xd32e25121">201</a> and furnished with a sheath which is generally of wood and quite plain, but <span class="pageNum" id="pb526">[<a href="#pb526">526</a>]</span>sometimes of metal chased, hammered, and set with gems in the most elaborate and lavish
style. The blade is quite different in appearance from the steel or iron blades to
which we are accustomed, being prepared in a peculiar way by a process of “damasking”
which produces a variety of designs on the roughened surface. To the shape of these
designs much importance is attached, as will appear from the following passage extracted
from Newbold’s <i>British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca:</i>—
</p>
<p>“<i>Translation of Malayan MS. on Krises and Process of Damasking</i>
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Fasl I.—On the Pamur, or Damasking of Krises</span>
</p>
<p>“If the damasking of a <i lang="ms">kris</i> only reach within a finger’s breadth of the point, and if it reach the edge, it is
inauspicious for combat. Should the damask not be even with the point, a stab made
with such a <i lang="ms">kris</i> would err; but if even, then the <i lang="ms">kris</i> will never deviate, although its possessor lose strength to thrust; still, by the
grace of God, it will hit the mark should he cast it at his adversary. If it be damasked
on both sides, it is good; but not so should the damask be separated at intervals.
</p>
<p>“If the damask on the point be that of <i lang="ms">Alif besar</i> (a damask running in the shape of the Arabian letter <i lang="ms">Alif</i>), the <i lang="ms">kris</i> is good for combat; but it is not lucky to wear such a weapon while trading, nor
one in which the damask runs from the <i lang="ms">pangkal</i> (the stem which runs into the handle), to the <i lang="ms">tali</i>.
</p>
<p>“If it possess the <i lang="ms">Alif</i> damask near the handle, the middle, and point, it is very auspicious for commercial
transactions; men cannot resist the force of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb527">[<a href="#pb527">527</a>]</span>possessor’s arguments; should it be worn whilst planting, the crop will be fruitful.
The possessor will be irresistible in fight, nor can any person thwart his wishes.
</p>
<p>“If the <i lang="ms">kris</i> (called <i lang="ms">Tuah</i>) have the <i lang="ms">pamur kutilang</i>, or the bird’s-eye damask, at its point and stem, it becomes entitled to the appellation
<i lang="ms">Manikam<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25187src" href="#xd32e25187">202</a> di Ujong Gala</i> (the ruby at the end of the pole). The possessor of such a <i lang="ms">kris</i> is most lucky. If the damask be that of <i lang="ms">battu ampar</i>, and reach to the <i lang="ms">ganja</i> (the lower part of the blade immediately above the <i lang="ms">ikat tali</i>), it ensures the safety of the wearer.
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Fasl II.—On the Blade of the Kris</span>
</p>
<p>“If the blade of the <i lang="ms">kris</i> be split in the direction of the <i lang="ms">tali tali</i> (the silk and ratan appendage by which the <i lang="ms">kris</i> is fastened in the girdle), you cannot return an adversary’s thrust with it. If the
<i lang="ms">betala</i> be cracked to the <i lang="ms">ikat tali</i> (or bottom welt), it is not auspicious. Should the point of the <i lang="ms">kris</i> be split, it is a sign that it requires blood; if this want be not gratified, the
possessor becomes sick.
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Fasl III.—On the Badik, or Sendrik</span>
</p>
<p>“If the blade of the <i lang="ms">badik</i> be damasked all over to its edge, it is lucky to wear while trading or dividing property.
If the back bear the damask <i lang="ms">Alif</i>, it is also good for trading with, or for combat, by God’s assistance. If the blade
have the <i lang="ms">pamur gunong</i>, or mountain damask, it softens the hearts of men, and is good for trading and warlike
excursions. If the lines <span class="pageNum" id="pb528">[<a href="#pb528">528</a>]</span>of damask be of equal breadth from the <i lang="ms">pangkal</i> to the <i lang="ms">tali</i>, and straight, it is auspicious.
</p>
<p>“Should the belly of the blade be veined, it is lucky to trade, and good for making
a stab with, as the possessor’s antagonist will not be able to return the thrust.
If the damask be that called <i lang="ms">pamur kait</i> (or the damask like a hook), it is auspicious.
</p>
<p>“Should the back of the blade be damasked and streaked, it is good; and also, if it
has the <i lang="ms">pamur belanga</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25268src" href="#xd32e25268">203</a> in one or two places only, and on its back. If the damask run waving from the top
to the bottom of the back, it is very auspicious.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25274src" href="#xd32e25274">204</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>“<i>How to damask krises.</i>—Place on the blade a mixture of boiled rice, sulphur, and salt beat together, first
taking the precaution to cover the edges of the weapon with a thin coat of virgin
wax. After this has remained on seven days, the damask will have risen to the surface;
take the composition off, and immerse the blade in the water of a young cocoa-nut,
or the juice of a pineapple, for seven days longer, and wash it well with the juice
of a sour lemon. After the rust has been cleared away, rub it with <i lang="ms">warangan</i> (arsenic) dissolved in lime juice; wash it well with spring water; dry, and anoint
it with cocoa-nut oil.
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Fasl IV.—Measurement of Krises</span>
</p>
<p>“Measure the <i lang="ms">kris</i> with a string below its <i lang="ms">aring</i> (a jutting out of the blade near its bottom) to its point; cut the string and fold
it trebly; cut off one of the trebles, and with the remaining two measure up the <span class="pageNum" id="pb529">[<a href="#pb529">529</a>]</span>blade of the <i lang="ms">kris</i>, then make a mark how far the string reaches. Measure the blade across at this mark,
and find how many times its breadth is contained in two-thirds of its length; cut
the string into as many pieces. These form the <i lang="ms">sloca</i>, or measure, of which the <i lang="ms">kris</i> consists. If none of the string remain over, the blade is perfect, if a minute portion
remain, it is less perfect, but if half the breadth remain, or more, it is <i lang="ms">chelaka</i>, unlucky.”
</p>
<p>Newbold adds:—
</p>
<p>“The <i lang="ms">krises</i> most preferred are those of the kinds termed Simpana, Cherita, and Sapokal. The <i lang="ms">kris panjang</i> is worn generally by the Malayan aristocracy and bridegrooms. I have seen some beautiful
specimens of this weapon in Rumbowe, worn by the chiefs of that state. The blades
resembled that of a long, keen poniard of Damascus steel; the handles of ebony, covered
with flowered gold, and sheaths richly ornamented with the same metal; they are used
in the execution of criminals. Malays do not prize their <i lang="ms">krises</i> entirely by the quantity of gold with which they may be inlaid, but more for their
accurate proportions agreeably to the measurement which is laid down in their treatises
on this subject; the damask on the blade; the antiquity and a certain lucky quality
that they may possess either from accurate proportions, the damask, the having shed
human blood, or from supernatural endowment, like the famous sword “Excalibur.” This
property is termed <i lang="ms">betuah</i>, which signifies literally exempt from accident, invulnerable. The reverse is termed
<i lang="ms">chelaka</i>, ill-omened. They believe the <i lang="ms">betuah</i> in some cases imparts invulnerability to the possessor of such a <i lang="ms">kris</i>, which is handed down as an heirloom from father to son, and honoured as something
divine. The <i lang="ms">kris</i> is, as with the Javanese, an <span class="pageNum" id="pb530">[<a href="#pb530">530</a>]</span>indispensable article in dress on particular occasions, and there are numerous regulations
regarding the wearing of it. The Undang Undang Malacca<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25344src" href="#xd32e25344">205</a> contains strict injunctions, which are observed to this day, against a person of
inferior birth wearing a <i>kris</i> ornamented with gold.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25372src" href="#xd32e25372">206</a>
</p>
<p>Besides the mode above described, several other methods of measuring the <i lang="ms">k’ris</i> are also in vogue. They differ in various matters of detail, and will be found in
the Appendix.
</p>
<p>The measurement of one-edged weapons is effected as follows:—
</p>
<p>Measure the length of the weapon from hilt to point, and fold the string so measured
in two. Measure off this half-length from the hilt and see how often the breadth of
the blade is contained in the whole length of the string. Each time, however, that
the edge is reached, the string must be marked or dented, and the long end wrapped
round and round the blade, so that the measurement of each breadth is consecutive
to the preceding breadth, the portion of the string which is stretched across the
back of the blade not being counted.
</p>
<p>This method is called <i lang="ms">ukor mata sa-b’lah</i>, and is used by Sumatran Malays, especially in Menangkabau.
</p>
<p>Spearheads can also be measured:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb531">[<a href="#pb531">531</a>]</span></p>
<p>Measure off the length of the spearhead and fold the string in two; see how often
the breadth is contained in the half of the string; if the blade is a good one, it
must be five and a half times (<i lang="ms">tĕngah anam</i>). This is called <i lang="ms">ukor orang Perak</i> or <i lang="ms">ukor tĕngah anam</i>.
</p>
<p>Another superstition connected with weapons is described as follows by Sir Frank Swettenham.
It illustrates the magic powers attributed to the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> in so many departments of nature and life, but does not seem to have any special
object or meaning.
</p>
<p>“A great many Malays and one or two Europeans may be found who profess to have seen
water drawn from a <i lang="ms">kris</i>. The <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> is simple. The <i lang="ms">pâwang</i> (I dare not call him conjurer) works with bare arms to show there is no deception.
He takes the <i lang="ms">kris</i> (yours, if you prefer it) from its wooden handle, and, holding the steel point downwards
in his left hand, he recites a short incantation to the effect that he knows all about
iron, and where it comes from, and that it must obey his orders. He then with the
thumb and first two fingers of his right hand proceeds to gently squeeze the steel,
moving his fingers up and down the blade. After a little while a few drops of water
fall from the point of the <i lang="ms">kris</i>, and these drops quickly develop into a stream that will fill a cup. The <i lang="ms">pâwang</i> will then hand round the blade and tell you to bend it; this you will find no difficulty
in doing, but by making two or three passes over the <i lang="ms">kris</i> the <i lang="ms">pâwang</i> can render it again so hard that it cannot be bent.
</p>
<p>“The only drawback to this trick or miracle is that the process ruins the temper of
the steel, and a <i lang="ms">kris</i> that has been thus treated is useless.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25445src" href="#xd32e25445">207</a>
</p>
<p>The subject of this section, more perhaps than any <span class="pageNum" id="pb532">[<a href="#pb532">532</a>]</span>of the others, has lost its former importance, and become almost a matter of merely
historical interest. In the Malay Peninsula, at least in the States which are under
British protection, offensive weapons are seldom worn now-a-days except on State occasions
and for purely ceremonial purposes; and warfare, it may be hoped, is now a thing of
the past. In spite of the halo of romance thrown round it in native writings, Malay
warfare (in modern times, at least) has never been anything but the barest and most
bloodthirsty piracy by sea, and the merest “bushwhacking” and stockade-fighting on
land; its final suppression, even if in some degree it should involve a slackening
of fibre in the Malay character, is not a matter for regret. With it will disappear
much of the curious lore that surrounded it, and indeed a good deal of it must have
been lost already. Little has been said here of the methods of divination used in
warfare which take up so much space in Malay treatises on the subject; success in
war is held to depend on a great number of minute observances, and to be capable of
being foretold by careful attention to omens and signs. But the divination applied
in warfare does not seem to differ in principle from that which is used in all the
other avocations of life, and a sufficient idea of its nature will be gathered from
the account given in the next section.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The significance of ominous signs and dreams is a subject which possesses vast ramifications,
extending so deeply into every department of the Malay national life, that it will
be impossible to do it anything like <span class="pageNum" id="pb533">[<a href="#pb533">533</a>]</span>full justice within the narrow limits of this book. My object will be merely to indicate
the main lines on which these two important doctrines of the Malay natural religion
appear to have been developed.
</p>
<p>Briefly, then, omens may be drawn either from the acts of men or the events of nature.
Examples of the ominous import attributed to the acts of man will at once suggest
themselves. Thus sneezing is said to be fortunate as tending to drive away the demons
of disease;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25470src" href="#xd32e25470">208</a> yawning is a bad sign, for obvious reasons, if the breath is loudly emitted, but
if a quiet yawn occurs when the stomach is craving for food, it imports that it will
soon be filled. So too stumbling is a bad omen, especially if the person who stumbles
is about to set out on a journey.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25479src" href="#xd32e25479">209</a> Then, again, “to be long in getting up after a meal is said to be a bad omen. It
means that the person, if unmarried, will meet with a bad reception from his or her
parents-in-law hereafter. The Malay saying in the vernacular is ‘<i lang="ms">Lambat bangket deri tampat makan, lambat di-tegur mentuwak</i>.’ Clothes which have been nibbled by rats or mice must not be worn again. They are
sure to bring misfortune, and are generally given away in charity. … When a Malay
dinner is served, the younger members of the family sometimes amuse themselves by
throwing rice into the pan from which the curry has just been taken, stirring it round
in the gravy that remains and then eating it. This is not permitted when one of them
is to be married on the following <span class="pageNum" id="pb534">[<a href="#pb534">534</a>]</span>day, as it would be sure to bring rainy weather. It is unlucky for a child to lie
on his face (<i lang="ms">menyehrap</i>), and kick his feet together in the air (<i lang="ms">menyabong kaki</i>). It betokens that either his father or mother will die. A child seen doing this
is instantly rebuked and stopped.…
</p>
<p>“The evil eye is dreaded by Malays. Not only are particular people supposed to be
possessed of a quality which causes ill-luck to accompany their glance (the <i lang="it">mal’occhio</i> of the Italians), but the influence of the evil eye is often supposed to affect children,
who are taken notice of by people kindly disposed towards them. For instance, it is
unlucky to remark on the fatness and healthiness of a baby, and a Malay will employ
some purely nonsensical word, or convey his meaning in a roundabout form, rather than
incur possible misfortune by using the actual word ‘fat.’ ‘<i lang="ms">Ai bukan-nia poh-poh gental budak ini?</i>’ (‘Isn’t this child nice and round?’) is the sort of phrase which is permissible.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25504src" href="#xd32e25504">210</a>
</p>
<p>Among omens drawn from natural events are the following:—
</p>
<p>“When a star is seen in apparent proximity to the moon, old people say there will
be a wedding shortly.…
</p>
<p>“The entrance into a house of an animal which does not generally seek to share the
abode of man is regarded by the Malays as ominous of misfortune. If a wild bird flies
into a house it must be carefully caught and smeared with oil, and must then be released
in the open air, a formula being recited in which it is bidden to fly away with all
the ill-luck and misfortunes <span class="pageNum" id="pb535">[<a href="#pb535">535</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">sial jambalang</i>) of the occupier. An iguana, a tortoise, and a snake, are perhaps the most dreaded
of these unnatural visitors. They are sprinkled with ashes, if possible, to counteract
their evil influence.
</p>
<p>“A swarm of bees settling near a house is an unlucky omen, and prognosticates misfortune.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25522src" href="#xd32e25522">211</a>
</p>
<p>So, too, omens are taken either from the flight or cries of certain birds, such as
the night-owl, the crow, some kinds of wild doves, and the bird called the “Rice’s
Husband” (<i lang="ms">laki padi</i>).
</p>
<p>Passing from the idea of mere omens drawn from fortuitous events we easily arrive
at the idea of a conscious attempt on the part of the worshipper to ascertain the
divine pleasure with respect to a sacrifice newly offered. This effort of the worshippers
becomes crystallised in time into a sub-rite, which yet forms an integral portion
of most, if not all, of the more important ceremonies,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25533src" href="#xd32e25533">212</a> and eventually develops into a special and separate rite called <i lang="ms">Tilek</i> (divination), of which examples will now be given.
</p>
<p>One form of this rite was taught by a Malay of Penang extraction, whose instructions,
taken down by me at the time, ran as follows:—
</p>
<p>Take a lemon (<i lang="ms">limau purut</i>), a hen’s egg, a taper made of bees’-wax (<i lang="ms">lilin lĕbah</i>), four bananas, four Malay (palm-leaf covered) cigarettes, four “chews” of betel-leaf,
a handful of parched rice, washed rice, <span class="pageNum" id="pb536">[<a href="#pb536">536</a>]</span>and rice stained with turmeric (saffron), one of the prickles or “thorns” (<i lang="ms">duri</i>) of a thorn-backed mudfish, a needle with a torn eye (taken out of one of the sets
of a “score” in which they are sold—<i lang="ms">jarum rabit dalam sĕkudi</i>), and a couple of small whips, or rather birches, one of which must be composed of
seven, and the other of twelve, leaf-ribs of the “green” cocoa-nut palm (<i lang="ms">niyor hijau</i>).
</p>
<p>Two of the bananas, two cigarettes, two chews of “betel,” half of each of the three
kinds of rice, the egg, and the birch of seven twigs, must now be taken outside the
house and set down under a tree selected for the purpose. When setting it down the
egg must be cracked, the cigarettes lighted, and finally the taper also. On one occasion
when I witnessed the performance, the taper, after being taken up between the outstretched
fingers of my friend’s two hands, was waved slowly to and fro—first to the right and
then to the left; finally it was set down on the ground and began to burn blue, the
flame becoming more and more dim until it almost expired. On seeing this the medicine-man
exclaimed, “He has promised” (<i lang="ms">dia mĕngaku</i>), and led the way back to the house, where he proceeded to go through the remainder
of the ceremony.
</p>
<p>First, he deposited the brazier with incense upon the leaf of a banana-tree, then
took the prickle of the fish and thrust it horizontally through the lower end of the
lemon, leaving both ends exposed; then he thrust the needle through in a transverse
direction, so as to form a cross, the ends of the needle being likewise exposed, and
slipped the noosed end of a piece of silken thread of seven different colours over
the points thus exposed.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb537">[<a href="#pb537">537</a>]</span></p>
<p>Next he scattered the rice round the censer and fumigated the birch and the lemon,
recited a charm as he held the latter in his right hand, recited the charm for the
second time<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25598src" href="#xd32e25598">213</a> as he took the birch in both hands, with the upper end close to his mouth and the
lower (spreading) end over the brazier, and finally repeated the charm for a third
time, suspending, as he did so, the lemon over the brazier by means of the thread
held in his left hand and holding the birch in the right.
</p>
<p>Everything being ready, he now began to put questions to the lemon into which the
spirit was supposed to have entered, rebuking it and threatening it with the birch
whenever it failed to answer distinctly and to the point. The conversational powers
of this spirit were extremely limited, being confined to two signs signifying “Yes”
and “No.” The affirmative was indicated by a pendulum-like swaying of the lemon, which
rocked to and fro with more or less vehemence according to the emphasis (as my friend
informed me) with which the reply was to be delivered. Negation, on the other hand,
was indicated by a complete cessation of motion on the part of the lemon.
</p>
<p>When it is required to discover, for instance, the name of a thief, the names of all
those who are at all likely to have committed the theft are written on scraps of paper
and arranged in a circle round the brazier, when the lemon will at once swing in the
direction of the name of the guilty party. The best night for the performance of this
ceremony is a Tuesday.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb538">[<a href="#pb538">538</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sir Frank Swettenham’s account of a similar ceremony of which he was an eye-witness
will serve as a good illustration of the methods in use for this purpose:—
</p>
<p>“It was my misfortune some years ago to be robbed of some valuable property, and several
Malay friends strongly advised me to take the advice of an astrologer, or other learned
person who (so they said) would be able to give the name of the thief, and probably
recover most of the stolen things. I fear that I had no great faith in this method
of detection, but I was anxious to see what could be done, for the East is a curious
place, and no one with an inquiring mind can have lived in it long without seeing
phenomena that are not always explained by modern text-books on Natural Philosophy.
</p>
<p>“I was first introduced to an Arab of very remarkable appearance. He was about fifty
years old, tall, with pleasant features and extraordinary gray-blue eyes, clear and
far-seeing, a man of striking and impressive personality. I was travelling when I
met him, and tried to persuade him to return with me, but that he said he could not
do, though he promised to follow me by an early steamer. He said he would be able
to tell me all about the robbery, who committed it, where the stolen property then
was, and that all he would want was an empty house wherein he might fast in solitude
for three days, without which preparation, he said, he would not be able to see what
he sought. He told me that after his vigil, fast, and prayer, he would lay in his
hand a small piece of paper on which there would be some writing; into this he would
pour a little water, and in that extemporised mirror he would see a vision of the
whole transaction. <span class="pageNum" id="pb539">[<a href="#pb539">539</a>]</span>He declared that, after gazing intently into this divining-glass, the inquirer first
recognised the figure of a little old man. That having duly saluted this <i lang="ms">Jin</i>, it was necessary to ask him to conjure up the scene of the robbery, when all the
details would be re-enacted in the liquid glass under the eyes of the gazer, who would
there and then describe all that he saw. I had heard all this before, only it had
been stated to me then that the medium through whose eyes the vision could alone be
seen must be a young child of such tender years that it could have never told a lie!
The Arab, however, professed himself not only able to conjure up the scene, but to
let me see it for myself if I would follow his directions. Unfortunately, my gray-eyed
friend failed to keep his promise, and I never met him again.
</p>
<p>“A local Chief, however, declared his power to read the past by this method, if only
he could find the truthful child. In this he appeared to succeed, but when, on the
following day, he came to disclose to me the results of his skill, he said that a
difficulty had arisen, because just when the child (a little boy) was beginning to
relate what he saw he suddenly became unconscious, and it took the astrologer two
hours to restore him to his normal state. All the mothers of tender-aged and possibly
truthful children declined after this to lend their offspring for the ordeal.
</p>
<p>“My friend was not, however, at the end of his resources, and, though only an amateur
in divination, he undertook to try by other methods to find the culprit. For this
purpose he asked me to give him the names of every one in the house at the time the
robbery was committed. I did so, and the next day he gave me one of those names as
that of the thief. I <span class="pageNum" id="pb540">[<a href="#pb540">540</a>]</span>asked how he had arrived at this knowledge; he described the method, and consented
to repeat the experiment in my presence. That afternoon I went with him to a small
house belonging to his sister. Here I found the Chief, his sister, and two men whom
I did not recognise. We all sat in a very small room, the Chief in the centre with
a copy of the Korân on a reading-stand, near to him the two men opposite to each other,
the sister against one wall, and I in a corner. A clean, new, unglazed earthenware
bowl with a wide rim was produced. This was filled with water and a piece of fair
white cotton cloth tied over the top, making a surface like that of a drum.
</p>
<p>“I was asked to write the name of each person present in the house when the robbery
was committed on a small piece of paper, and to fold each paper up so that all should
be alike, and then to place one of the names on the cover of the vessel. I did so,
and the proceedings began by the two men placing each the middle joint of the fore-finger
of his right hand under the rim of the bowl on opposite sides, and so supporting it
about six inches above the floor. The vessel being large and full of water was heavy,
and the men supported the strain by resting their right elbows on their knees as they
sat cross-legged on the floor and face to face. It was then that I selected one of
the folded papers, and placed it on the cover of the vessel. The Chief read a page
of the Korân, and as nothing happened he said that was not the name of the guilty
person, and I changed the paper for another. This occurred four times, but at the
fifth the reading had scarcely commenced when the bowl began to slowly turn round
from left to right, the supporters letting their hands go round with it, until it
twisted itself out of <span class="pageNum" id="pb541">[<a href="#pb541">541</a>]</span>their fingers and fell on the floor with a considerable bang and a great spluttering
of water through the thin cover. ‘That,’ said the Chief, ‘is the name of the thief.’
</p>
<p>“It was the name of the person already mentioned by him.
</p>
<p>“I did not, however, impart that piece of information to the company, but went on
to the end of my papers, nothing more happening.
</p>
<p>“I said I should like to try the test again, and as the Chief at once consented we
began afresh, and this time I put the name of the suspected person on first, and once
more the vessel turned round and twisted itself out of the hands of the holders till
it fell on the floor, and I was surprised it did not break. After trying a few more
I said I was satisfied, and the ordeal of the bowl was over. Then the Chief asked
me whose name had been on the vessel when it moved, and I told him. It was a curious
coincidence certainly. I wrote the names in English, which no one could read; moreover,
I was so placed that no one could see what I wrote, and they none of them attempted
to do so. Then the papers were folded up so as to be all exactly alike; they were
shuffled together, and I did not know one from the other till I looked inside myself.
Each time I went from my corner and placed a name on the vessel already held on the
fingers of its supporters. No one except I touched the papers, and no one but the
Chief ever spoke till the <i>séance</i> was over. I asked the men who held the bowl why they made it turn round at that particular
moment, but they declared they had nothing to do with it, and that the vessel twisted
itself off their fingers against their inclination.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb542">[<a href="#pb542">542</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The name disclosed by this experiment was certainly that of the person whom there
was most reason to suspect, but beyond that I learnt nothing.
</p>
<p>“Another plan for surprising the secret of the suspected person is to get into the
room where that person is sleeping, and after making certain passes to question the
slumberer, when he may truthfully answer all the questions put to him. This is a favourite
device of the suspicious husband.
</p>
<p>“Yet another plan is to place in the hand of a <i lang="ms">pâwang</i>, magician, or medium, a divining-rod formed of three lengths of rattan, tied together
at one end, and when he gets close to the person ‘wanted,’ or to the place where anything
stolen is concealed, the rod vibrates in a remarkable manner.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25638src" href="#xd32e25638">214</a>
</p>
<p>A somewhat analogous practice is the ordeal by diving, described by the late Sir W.&nbsp;E.
Maxwell as “a method of deciding a disputed point which was occasionally resorted
to in Perak in former times. I got the following account of the manner of conducting
the ordeal from a Malay chief who saw it carried out once at Tanjong Sanendang near
Pasir Sala, in the reign of Sultan Abdullah Mohamed Shah, father of the present Raja
Muda Yusuf:—
</p>
<p>“The ordeal by diving requires the sanction of the Sultan himself, and must be conducted
in the presence of the Orang Besar Ampat, or Four Chiefs of the first rank. If two
disputants in an important question agree to settle their difference in this way they
apply to the Raja, who fixes a day (usually three days off) for the purpose, and orders
that a certain sum of money shall abide the event. This appointment of time and place
is the first stage in the proceedings, and is called <span class="pageNum" id="pb543">[<a href="#pb543">543</a>]</span><i lang="ms">bertepat janji</i>, and the laying of the bet or deposit of stakes is called <i lang="ms">bertiban taroh</i>. On the day appointed the parties attend with their friends at the Raja’s <i lang="ms">balei</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25656src" href="#xd32e25656">215</a> and there, in the presence of the Court, a <i lang="ms">krani</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25662src" href="#xd32e25662">216</a> writes down a solemn declaration for each person, each maintaining the truth of his
side of the question. The first, invoking the name of God, the intercession of the
Prophet, and the tombs of the deceased Sultans of the country, asserts the affirmative
proposition, and his adversary with the same solemnity records his denial. This is
called <i lang="ms">bertangkap mangmang</i> or ‘taking up the challenge.’ Each paper is then carefully rolled up by the <i lang="ms">krani</i>, and is placed by him in a separate bamboo tube; the ends of both are then sealed
up. When thus prepared the bamboo tubes are exactly alike, and no one, not even the
<i lang="ms">krani</i>, can tell which contains the assertion and which the denial. Two boys are then selected;
one of the bamboos is given to each, and they are led down to the river, where the
Raja and Chiefs take up their station, and the people flock down in crowds. Two stakes
have been driven into the bed of the river in a pool previously selected, and the
boys are placed beside them, up to their necks in water. A pole is placed horizontally
on their heads, and on a given signal this is pressed downwards, and the boys are
made to sink at the same moment. Each holds on to his post under water and remains
below as long as he can. As soon as one gives in and appears above water his bamboo
tube is snatched from him and hurled far out into the stream. The victor is led up
in triumph to the <i lang="ms">balei</i>, and the crowd surges up to hear the result. His bamboo is then opened and the winner
declared.

<span class="pageNum" id="pb544">[<a href="#pb544">544</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The Perak Malays believe this to be an infallible test of the truth of a cause. The
boy who holds the false declaration is half-drowned, they say, as soon as his head
is under the water, whereas the champion of the truth is able to remain below until
the bystanders drag the post out of the river with the boy still clinging to it. Such
is the power of the truth backed by the sacred names and persons invoked!
</p>
<p>“The loser is often fined in addition to suffering the loss of his stakes (one-half
of which goes to the Raja). He also has to pay the customary fees, namely, $6.25 for
the use of the <i lang="ms">balei</i>, $12.50 to the <i lang="ms">krani</i>, and $5 to each of the boys.
</p>
<p>“This ordeal is not peculiar to Perak. I find a short description of a similar custom
in Pegu in Hamilton’s <i>New Accounts of the East Indies</i> (1727). In Pegu, he says, the ordeal by water is managed ‘by driving a stake of wood
into a river and making the accuser and accused take hold of the stake and keep their
heads and bodies under water, and he who stays longest under water is the person to
be credited.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25711src" href="#xd32e25711">217</a>
</p>
<p>But by far the largest class of divinatory rites consists of astrological calculations
based on the supposed values of times and seasons, or the properties of numbers. For
the purposes of the native astrologer, exhaustive tables of lucky and unlucky times
and seasons have been compiled, which are too long to be all examined here in detail,
but of which specimens will be found in the Appendix. Few of them are likely to be
original productions, most, if not all, being undoubtedly translated from similar
books in vogue <span class="pageNum" id="pb545">[<a href="#pb545">545</a>]</span>either in India or Arabia. Besides these tables, however, use is frequently made of
geometrical (and even of natural) diagrams, to the more important parts of which certain
numerical values are assigned.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25725src" href="#xd32e25725">218</a>
</p>
<p>Perhaps the oldest and best known of the systems of lucky and unlucky times is the
one called <i lang="ms">Katika<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25732src" href="#xd32e25732">219</a> Lima</i>, or the Five Times. Under it the day is divided into five parts, and five days form
a cycle<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25739src" href="#xd32e25739">220</a>: to each of these divisions is assigned a name, the names being Maswara (Maheswara),
Kala, S’ri, Brahma, and Bisnu (Vishnu), which recur in the order shown in the following
table or diagram:—

<p>These names are the names of Hindu divinities, <span class="pageNum" id="pb546">[<a href="#pb546">546</a>]</span>Maheswara being Shiva, and constituting with Brahma and Vishnu the so-called Hindu
Trinity, while Kala is either another title of Shiva, or stands for Kali, his wife,
and S’ri is a general title of all Hindu gods<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25898src" href="#xd32e25898">221</a>; but it may be doubted whether this division of time is not of Javanese or Malayan
origin, although the importance of the number <i>five</i> is also recognised by the Hindus.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25922src" href="#xd32e25922">222</a>
</p>
<p>The same mystic notions of colour and the like are attached to these divisions by
the Malays as obtain in the case of the Javanese days of the week: thus Maheswara’s
colour is yellow-white (<i lang="ms">puteh kuning</i>): if you go out you will meet a man of yellow-white complexion, or wearing yellow-white
clothes; it is a lucky time for asking a boon from a Raja, or for doing any kind of
work; good news then received is true, bad news is false, and so on.
</p>
<p>Kala’s colour is a reddish black (<i lang="ms">hitam merah</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25949src" href="#xd32e25949">223</a>); if you go out you will meet a bad man or have a quarrel; it is an unlucky time
altogether: the good news one hears turns out untrue, and the bad true; illness occurring
at this time is due to a ghost (<i lang="ms">hantu orang</i>), and the remedy is a black fowl; in cock-fighting a black cock will beat a white
one at this time, but when setting him to fight you must not face towards the west,
etc.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb547">[<a href="#pb547">547</a>]</span></p>
<p>Similarly S’ri’s colour is white, Brahma’s is red, Vishnu’s is green, and each division
has its respective advantages or disadvantages.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25962src" href="#xd32e25962">224</a>
</p>
<p>Another version of this system, known as the Five Moments (<i lang="ms">saʿat</i>), is based on a somewhat similar diagram, but has orthodox Muhammadan names for its
divisions, viz. Ahmad, Jibra’il (Gabriel), Ibrahim (Abraham), Yusuf (Joseph), and
ʿAzra’il (Azrael).
</p>
<p>Its diagram, as will be seen, is not quite the same as that of the <i lang="ms">Katika Lima</i>, though the general scheme of the two systems corresponds closely.

<p>So in Ahmad’s division if you lose a buffalo or a bullock, it has gone to the southward
and will be recovered; good news then received is true, bad news is false; the time
is auspicious for any kind of work, for going on a voyage, sailing, or planting, and
very profitable for trading; it is a lucky time for going to war, but you must wear
white clothes and face southwards by a little east, and pray to God Almighty. Jibra’il’s
time is fairly lucky too, being good for planting and profitable for trading, and
if gold or silver is lost then, it will be quickly found, but there may be some trouble
in getting it back; a lost buffalo <span class="pageNum" id="pb548">[<a href="#pb548">548</a>]</span>or bullock has gone southwards, but will be recovered after some slight trouble; if
you go to war at this time you must wear green, but must not face towards the south.
Ibrahim’s time is most unlucky, and going out then is sure to involve bloodshed or
other misfortune; bad news is true, good is false; things lost then will not be recovered;
going to war is ruinous, and if you do go, the only way of safety is to face to the
north, but it is best to stay at home altogether at this time.
</p>
<p>Yusuf’s time is lucky in some respects, but unlucky in others; in warfare one must
face towards the west, and wear yellow. ʿAzra’il’s time is most unlucky; to go to
war then is most disastrous; any business pending at this ill-omened time should be
postponed to a more favourable occasion.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26100src" href="#xd32e26100">226</a>
</p>
<p>Besides these two there is a system in which each of the seven days of the ordinary
week is divided into five parts, each of which is characterised by one of the words
<i lang="ms">ampa</i>, <i lang="ms">bangkei</i>, <i lang="ms">rezki</i>, and <i lang="ms">aral</i> (for <i lang="ms">ʿaradl</i>), symbolical apparently of No Success, Death, Success, and Unforeseen Obstacle.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26124src" href="#xd32e26124">227</a>
</p>
<p>Another scheme (<i lang="ms">Katika Tujoh</i>), based on the Seven Heavenly Bodies, divides each day into seven parts, each of
which is distinguished by the Arabic name of one of the Heavenly Bodies.
</p>
<p>The first day runs,—

</p>
<p>and the times are—early morning (<i lang="ms">pagi-pagi</i>), morning <span class="pageNum" id="pb549">[<a href="#pb549">549</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">tĕngah naik</i>), just before noon (<i lang="ms">hampir tĕngah hari</i>), noon (<i lang="ms">tĕngah hari</i>), afternoon (<i lang="ms">dlohr</i>), late afternoon (<i lang="ms">ʿasr</i>), and sunset (<i lang="ms">maghrib</i>).
</p>
<p>For the second day the series begins with the Moon, and goes on in the above order
to Mercury; and for the third day it begins with Mars; so that each day of the week
begins with its appropriate planet in the <i>usual</i> order, which is best seen in the French names Mardi, Mercredi, Jeudi, Vendredi, and
the English Saturday, Sunday and Monday.
</p>
<p>Each of the seven divisions has its lucky or unlucky characteristics, much as in the
systems already described.
</p>
<p>Besides these, each day of the week has its own appropriate occupations, according
to another system, at times ascertained by measuring the length of one’s shadow. Further,
it would appear that some days are unlucky altogether: one account gives seven unlucky
days in every month; another asserts that Thursday is unlucky in the months Dhu-’l-hijjah,
Muharram, and Safar; Tuesday in Rabiʿ-al-awal, Rabiʿ-al-akhir, and Jumada-’l-awal;
Saturday in Jumada-’l-akhir, Rĕjab and Shaʿban; Sunday in Ramadhan, Shawal, and Dhu-’l-kaʿidah;
a third specifies twelve other most inauspicious days in every year, viz. the 28th
of Muharram, the 10th of Safar, the 14th of Rabiʿ-al-awal, and so on, while for greater
convenience a calendar has been drawn up, which is far too long to be reproduced here,
but which closely resembles the weather chart illustrated on another page, and gives
the whole list of days of the Muhammadan year classified under the heads lucky (<i lang="ms">baik</i>), somewhat unlucky, very unlucky, and neutral.
</p>
<p>Besides this, whole years are lucky or unlucky <span class="pageNum" id="pb550">[<a href="#pb550">550</a>]</span>according as the first of Muharram falls on a Sunday, Monday, etc.; and, moreover,
years vary in luck according to the letter they bear in the Cycle of Eight.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26254src" href="#xd32e26254">228</a>
</p>
<p>Most of these systems of divination involve the construction of a sort of calendar,
and require some degree of astronomical knowledge; but of astronomy properly so-called
the Malays have scarcely even a smattering, its place being taken by the, to them,
far more important science of astrology. “Their meagre ideas regarding the motions
of the heavenly bodies are derived, through the Arabs, from the Ptolemaic system.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26262src" href="#xd32e26262">229</a>
</p>
<p>The seven Heavenly Bodies (<i lang="ms">Bintang Tujoh</i>), mentioned above, whose motions they believe to be produced by the agency of angels,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26273src" href="#xd32e26273">230</a> retain their Arabic names,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26277src" href="#xd32e26277">231</a> and are believed to rule the “seven ominous moments” (<i lang="ms">Katika Tujoh</i>), which are supposed to depend on the influences of these several sidereal bodies.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26299src" href="#xd32e26299">232</a>
</p>
<p>The signs of the Zodiac similarly bear Arabic appellations, the form of divination
in which they bear the principal part being called the Twelve Constellations (<i lang="ms">Bintang Dua-b’las</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26309src" href="#xd32e26309">233</a>
</p>
<p>This form of divination is not quite so common as are those of the Five Ominous Times
(5-square) and the Seven Heavenly Bodies (7-square), and I have not been able to find
out much about the methods of working it, but a copy of one of the diagrams used for
the purpose will be found on another page.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb551">[<a href="#pb551">551</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to one view, which is perhaps the prevalent one, every man’s luck is determined
by one or other of the zodiacal constellations, and in order to find out which one
it is, the following direction is given:—
</p>
<p>“Reckon the numerical equivalent of the person’s name and of the name of his mother
by the values of the letters according to the system of the Abjad; add the two numerical
equivalents together, and divide the total by twelve; if the remainder is 1, his sign
is the Ram, if 2, the Bull, and so on.”
</p>
<p>Each constellation has a series of characteristics which are supposed to influence
the whole life of the person who is subject to it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26321src" href="#xd32e26321">234</a>
</p>
<p>Besides the above, a few of the other constellations are known to possess Malay names,
and wherever this is the case, the name given appears usually to be quite original,
having no connection with the nomenclature obtaining among nations with which we are
more familiar.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26332src" href="#xd32e26332">235</a>
</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the Malays possess a curious system by which the lunar month
is divided into a number of parts called <i lang="ms">Rĕjang</i>. According to Newbold, “the twenty-eight <i lang="ms">Rĕjangs</i> resemble the Nacshatras or lunar mansions of the Hindoos, rather than <span class="pageNum" id="pb552">[<a href="#pb552">552</a>]</span>the Anwa of the Arabs”;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26395src" href="#xd32e26395">236</a> and it is <i>a priori</i> very probable that they owe their origin to this Hindu system. But by the Malays
their application has been generally misunderstood, and their number is usually raised
to thirty so as to fit the days of the lunar month. Each of these divisions has its
symbol, which is usually an animal, and the first animal in the list is (in almost
all versions) the horse. A horse’s head is also the figure of the first of the Hindu
Nakshatras, but there seems to be little trace of identity in the remaining figures,
which for the sake of comparison are given, side by side with the Malay symbols, in
the Appendix. The Malays have embodied this system in a series of mnemonic verses
(known as <i lang="ms">Shaʿir Rĕjang</i>), of which there are several versions, <i>e.g.</i> the <i lang="ms">Rĕjang</i> of ’Che Busu, the <i lang="ms">Rĕjang Sindiran Maiat</i>, and others.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26416src" href="#xd32e26416">237</a>
</p>
<p>The <i lang="ms">Rĕjangs</i> are also dealt with at length in prose treatises: one of these, which identifies
the <i lang="ms">Rĕjangs</i> with the days of the lunar month, begins “on the first day of the month, whose <i lang="ms">rĕjang</i> is a horse, God Almighty created the prophet Adam; this day is good for planting,
travelling, and sailing, and trading on this day will be profitable; it is also a
good day for a wedding, and on this day it is lucky to be attacked (<i>i.e.</i> in war), but rather unlucky to take the offensive; … good news received (at this
time) is true, bad news is false; property lost (on this day) will soon be recovered;
the man who stole it is short of stature, with scanty hair, a round face, a slender
figure and a yellow complexion; the property has been placed in a house, … under the
care of a dark man; … if a <span class="pageNum" id="pb553">[<a href="#pb553">553</a>]</span>child is born on this day it will be extremely fortunate; if one is ill on this day,
one will quickly recover; the proper remedy for driving away the evil (<i lang="ms">tolak bala</i>), is <i>to make a representation of a horse and throw it away towards the</i> (East?)”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26446src" href="#xd32e26446">238</a> In other respects this system of divination seems to agree in its main features with
those which have already been described.
</p>
<p>Having mentioned the divisions of the calendar which are chiefly used in divination,
it seems desirable, for the sake of completeness, to allude briefly to those that
remain.
</p>
<p>“The better informed Malays acknowledge the solar year of 365 days, which they term
the <i lang="ms">toun</i> (<i lang="ms">tahun</i>) <i lang="ms">shemsiah</i>, but in obedience to their Mohammedan instructors, adopt the lunar year (<i lang="ms">toun kumriah</i>) of 354 days.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26464src" href="#xd32e26464">239</a>
</p>
<p>This remark is still true, no doubt, of the up-country Malays on the West Coast, but
in most districts, and to an extent commensurate with European influence, the solar
year is now being gradually introduced.
</p>
<p>The same remark applies to the method of reckoning months, a dual system being now
in vogue in many places where there is most contact with Europeans. Regarding the
native methods the following quotation is to the point:—
</p>
<p>“There are three ways of reckoning the months. First, the Arabian, computing thirty
days to the first <span class="pageNum" id="pb554">[<a href="#pb554">554</a>]</span>month, and twenty-nine to the second month, and so on alternately to the end of the
year.
</p>
<p>“Second, the Persian mode, viz. thirty days to each month; and, thirdly, that of Rum,
<i>i.e.</i> thirty-one days to the month. The first is in general use. Some few, with greater
accuracy, calculate their year at 354 days eight hours, intercalating every three
years twenty-four hours, or one day to make up the deficiency, and thirty-three days
for the difference between the solar and lunar years.
</p>
<p>“But the majority of the lower classes estimate their year by the fruit seasons and
by their crops of rice only. Many, however, obstinately adhere to the lunar months,
and plant their paddy at the annual return of the lunar month.”
</p>
<p>“The Malay months have been divided into weeks of seven days, marked by the return
of the Mohammedan Sabbath. Natives who have had intercourse with Europeans divide
the day and night into twenty-four parts, but the majority measure the day by the
sun’s apparent progress through the heavens, the crow of the cock, etc. The religious
day commences at sunset, like that of the Arabs and Hebrews.”
</p>
<p>“There are two cycles borrowed from the Arabs, and known only to a few, viz. one of
120 years, the <i lang="ms">dour<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26486src" href="#xd32e26486">240</a> besar</i>, and the other of eight, <i lang="ms">dour kechil</i>. The latter is sometimes seen in dates of letters, and resembles the mode adopted
by us of distinguishing by letters the different days of the week, substituting eight
years for the seven days. The order of the letters is as follows: <i lang="ms">Alif-ha-jim-za-dal-ba-wau-dal-Ahajazdabuda</i>. The present year (1251) is the year <i lang="ms">Toun-za</i>.
</p>
<p>“In a Malay MS. history of Patani, in my possession, <span class="pageNum" id="pb555">[<a href="#pb555">555</a>]</span>I find the Siamese mode of designating the different years of the cycle by the names
of animals adopted.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26506src" href="#xd32e26506">241</a>

</p>
<p>Most if not all these systems of reckoning seem to have been treated by the Malays
from the astrological point of view as forming a basis for divination, and these crude
notions of the lucky or unlucky nature of certain times and seasons are to some extent
systematised by or in some degree mixed up with the idea of the mystic influence of
numbers and geometrical figures.
</p>
<p>Of the mystic figures used in divination, the first in importance is, no doubt, what
has been called the “magic square,” a term applied to “a set of numbers arranged in
a square in such a manner that the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal columns shall
give the same sums.”
</p>
<p>The ordinary form of magic square, which was formerly in use in Europe, is the following;
it is occasionally found even among the Malays.

<p>The ordinary Malay astrologer most likely understands very little of the peculiar
properties of a magic square, and consequently he not unfrequently makes mistakes
in the arrangement of the figures. I believe, also, that in using the squares for
purposes of divination he now usually begins at one corner and counts straight on,
the beginning place being almost always distinguished by a small solitary crescent
or crescent and star just over the square.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27125src" href="#xd32e27125">243</a> When coloured squares are introduced, as is the case with several of the 5-squares,
the sum of 25 squares is subdivided into five sets or groups of five squares each,
a different colour being assigned to each group. These colours would no doubt retain
the comparative values usually assigned <span class="pageNum" id="pb557">[<a href="#pb557">557</a>]</span>to them by Malay astrologers. Thus white would be the best of all; yellow, as the
royal colour, little, if at all inferior to white; brown, blue, or red would be medium
colours; black would be bad, and so on.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, again, the names of the five Hindu deities already mentioned will be found
similarly arranged, in which case they appear to refer to the divisions of the day,
described above under the name of <i lang="ms">Katika Lima</i>. Besides this class of magic squares, however, there are other kinds which present
irregularities, and are not so easily explainable. Some of these violate the fundamental
rule of the magic square, which insists that each square shall have an equal number
of small squares running each way, and that this number shall be an odd one.
</p>
<p>Others exhibit the right number of small squares (3 × 3 or 5 × 5 or 7 × 7), but instead
of a subdivision into sub-groups, have merely an arrangement of alternative emblems,
such as a bud and a full-blown flower, or the like.
</p>
<p>An analysis of the squares whose figures are given in the illustrations shows that
the order of the colours, deities, and planets is by no means always the same.
</p>
<p>Thus, in the matter of the order of the five colours, we have:—

these compass-like figures we find (<i>vide</i> Pl. 25, Fig. 2):—

<p>whilst a fourth has alternately cape and bay.
</p>
<p>The way in which these figures were used for divination is very clearly shown by Pl.
25, Fig. 1, which is copied from a figure in one of my (Selangor) charm-books, which
had the days of the month, from the 1st to the 30th, written round it in blue ink.
Starting from the north aspect, you count round to the left until (allowing one day
to each aspect) you arrive at the aspect corresponding to the number of the day of
the month upon which you wish to start your journey. If it coincides with an aspect
assigned to one of the weaker influences, it will be most imprudent to start on that
day. Start on a day assigned to one of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb560">[<a href="#pb560">560</a>]</span>stronger influences, and you will be all right. If the first aspect-compass which
you consult is not accommodating enough for your requirements, go on consulting others
until you find one which is satisfactory.
</p>
<p>Other forms of the compass-figure are used for divining whether if he starts on a
certain day the man will get the better of his enemy, or meet with a person (<i>e.g.</i> a slave or a thief) who has run away. In the former case a double circle of human
figures is used, the figures of the inner circle representing the person who seeks
the information, and those of the outer circle his enemy. The counting is carried
out in precisely the same manner as before, and the headless figure in each case represents
the man who will lose. In the case of a drawn battle neither party, of course, loses
his head.
</p>
<p>In the case of an absconder, a single circle of figures is used, the figures pointing
towards the centre signifying that the absconding party will return or be caught,
and those pointing away from the centre signifying the opposite. In one case (Pl.
25, Fig. 2) there are fourteen human figures arranged in two opposing rows of seven,
every alternate figure being headless. In this case you start the counting at the
right-hand figure of the bottom row, and count towards the left. Yet another form
of divination in which the human figure is made use of, is shown in Pl. 25, Fig. 1;
a number of small red circles (which should be alternately dark and light) are drawn
at the salient points of the figure, and counted down to the left in order, beginning
at the head. All I have yet been able to discover about the villainous-looking individual
here portrayed is the fact that he is said to represent one “Unggas Tĕlang,” who was
described to me as an <span class="pageNum" id="pb561">[<a href="#pb561">561</a>]</span>“old war-chief” (<i lang="ms">hulubalang tua</i>) of the Sea-gypsies (<i lang="ms">Orang Laut</i>) and the Malay pirates.

</p>
<p>Figures of dragons (<i lang="ms">naga</i>) and scorpions (<i lang="ms">kala</i>) are sometimes used in a similar manner; and there is also an aspect-compass known
as the <i lang="ms">Rajal-al-ghaib</i> or <i lang="ms">Jinazah Sayidna ʿAli ibn Abu Talib</i> (the body or bier of Our Lord ʿAli, the son of Abu Talib), which, according to this
notion, “is continually being carried by angels<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27615src" href="#xd32e27615">247</a> towards the different quarters of the heavens, and <i>must not be faced</i>; for if one faces towards it, one is sure to be defeated in battle or fight.” The
aspect to be avoided varies from day to day, turning towards each of the eight points
of the ordinary Malay compass three or four times in the lunar month.
</p>
<p>The subject of omens in general has been shortly dealt with at the beginning of this
section, and also incidentally mentioned in connection with various departments of
nature and human life. It would hardly be possible to make a complete or systematic
list of the things from which omens are taken. Apart from those depending merely on
Times, Seasons, Numbers, and Aspect, which have been already dealt with at quite sufficient
length, it may be noted that omens are drawn from earthquakes, thunder, “house-lizards,
rats, and other four-footed things,” according to the times at which they are observed,
from the colour, smell, and nature of soil (in choosing building-sites), from birds,
and, in fact, from a very large variety of matters which cannot be classified under
any general head. The lines of the hand are, of course, interpreted <span class="pageNum" id="pb562">[<a href="#pb562">562</a>]</span>among the Malays, as elsewhere, as signs of good and evil fortune. It has not been
possible to collect much information on the subject of Malay chiromancy, but for the
benefit of European adepts in “palmistry” (as it seems to be usually styled nowadays)
it may be worth while mentioning that the Malays attach importance, as an indication
of long life (<i lang="ms">ʿalamat panjang ʿumor</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27629src" href="#xd32e27629">248</a> to the intersection of the line round the base of the thumb<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27632src" href="#xd32e27632">249</a> with the one which runs round the wrist (<i lang="ms">simpeian ʿAli</i>), while a broken line across the palm (<i lang="ms">rĕtak putus</i>) is believed by them to be a sign of invulnerability (<i lang="ms">tanda pĕnggĕtas</i>, <i lang="ms">ta’ buleh di-tikam</i>). Upright lines running up the lower joints of the fingers, in the same line as the
fingers themselves, are a sign of prospective wealth (<i lang="ms">ʿalamat ’nak di-panjat dĕ’ duit</i>, <i lang="ms">tanda orang kaya</i>), and a whorl of circular lines on the fingers (<i lang="ms">pusat bĕlanak</i>) is a sign of a craftsman (<i lang="ms">ʿalamat orang tukang</i>).
</p>
<p>More important, perhaps, are the omens believed to be derived from dreams, of which
there seem to be several different methods of interpretation. According to one system
the initial letter of the thing dreamt of determines the luck: thus to dream of a
thing beginning with T is very lucky indeed, to dream of a thing beginning with H
means that a visitor from a distance is to be expected; N indicates sorrow, L is a
hint to give alms to the poor and needy, and so forth. According to another system,
a purely arbitrary meaning is put upon the subject-matter of the dream, or, at most,
some slight analogy is the basis of the interpretation. Thus to dream of a gale of
wind in the early morning is an omen of sorrow, to dream of hail <span class="pageNum" id="pb563">[<a href="#pb563">563</a>]</span>means acquisition of property, to dream of bathing in a heavy shower of rain indicates
escape from a very great danger, a dream about mosquitoes, flies, and the like, means
that an enemy is coming to the village, to dream about eating jack-fruit (<i lang="ms">nangka</i>) or plantain (<i lang="ms">pisang</i>) is an indication of great trouble impending, and so on; an extract from a treatise
on this subject is given in the Appendix, and it is impossible to dwell at greater
length upon it here. Among Malay gamblers special importance is attached to dreams
as an indication of luck in gambling (<i lang="ms">mimpi paksa</i> or <i lang="ms">dapat paksa</i>). If the gambler dreams of “sweeping out the gambling farm” (<i lang="ms">mĕnyapu pajak</i>), <i>i.e.</i> “breaking the bank,” or of running <i lang="ms">amok</i> in it (<i lang="ms">mĕngamok pajak</i>), or of bailing out the ocean (<i lang="ms">mĕnimba lautan</i>), or of the ocean running dry (<i lang="ms">lautan k’ring</i>), or even of his breeding maggots on his person (<i lang="ms">badan bĕrulat</i>), he is confident of great good fortune in the near future.
</p>
<p>As a specimen of the importance traditionally ascribed to dreams, it seems worth while
to give the following popular legend, which also illustrates the type of folk-tales
in which hidden treasure plays a great part:—
</p>
<p>“Che Puteh Jambai and his wife were very poor people, who lived many generations ago
at Pulo Kambiri on the Perak river. They had so few clothes between them that when
one went out the other had to stay at home. Nothing seemed to prosper with them, so
leaving Pulo Kambiri, where their poverty made them ashamed to meet their neighbours,
they moved up the river to the spot since called Jambai. Shortly after they had settled
here Che Puteh was troubled by a portent which has disturbed the slumbers of many
great men from the time of Pharaoh downwards. <span class="pageNum" id="pb564">[<a href="#pb564">564</a>]</span>He dreamed a dream. And in his dream he was warned by a supernatural visitant to slay
his wife, this being, he was assured, the only means by which he could hope to better
his miserable condition.
</p>
<p>“Sorely disturbed in mind, but never doubting that the proper course was to obey,
Che Puteh confided to his wife the commands which he had received, and desired her
to prepare for death. The unhappy lady acquiesced with that conjugal submissiveness
which in Malay legends, as in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, is so characteristic of the Oriental female when landed in some terrible predicament.
But she craved and obtained permission to first go down to the river and wash herself
with lime juice. So taking a handful of limes she went forth, and, standing on the
rock called Batu Pembunoh, she proceeded to perform her ablutions after the Malay
fashion. The prospect of approaching death, we may presume, unnerved her, for in dividing
the limes with a knife she managed to cut her own hand and the blood dripped down
on the rocks and into the river; as each drop was borne away by the current, a large
jar immediately rose to the surface and floated, in defiance of all natural laws,
<i>up-stream</i> to the spot whence the blood came. As each jar floated up Che Puteh’s wife tapped
it with her knife and pulled it in to the edge of the rocks. On opening them she found
them all full of gold. She then went in search of her husband and told him of the
treasure of which she had suddenly become possessed. He spared her life, and they
lived together in the enjoyment of great wealth and prosperity for many years. Their
old age was clouded, it is believed, by the anxiety attending the possession of a
beautiful daughter, who was born to them after they became rich. She grew up to the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb565">[<a href="#pb565">565</a>]</span>perfection of loveliness, and all the Rajas and Chiefs of the neighbouring countries
were her suitors. The multitude of rival claims so bewildered the unhappy parents
that, after concealing a great part of their riches in various places, they disappeared
and have never since been seen. Their property was never found by their children,
though, in obedience to instructions received in dreams, they braved sea-voyages and
went to seek for it in the distant lands of Kachapuri and Jamulepor.
</p>
<p>“Several places near Jambai connected with the legend of Che Puteh are still pointed
out; at Bukit Bunyian the treasure was buried and still lies concealed. A deep gorge
leading down to the river is the ghaut down which Che Puteh’s vast flocks of buffaloes
used to go to the river. Its size is evidence of the great number of the animals,
and therefore of the wealth of their owner. Two deep pools, called respectively Lubuk
Gong and Lubuk Sarunai, contain a golden gong and a golden flute which were sunk here
by Che Puteh Jambai. The flute may sometimes be seen lying on one of the surrounding
rocks, but always disappears into the depths of the pool before any mortal can approach
it. The treasures of Lubuk Gong might before now have passed into human possession,
had it not been for the covetousness of the individual selected as their recipient.
A Malay of Ulu Perak was told in a dream to go and fish in the pool of the gong and
to take a pair of betel-nut scissors (<i lang="ms">kachip</i>) with him. He was to use the <i lang="ms">kachip</i> immediately on being told to do so. Next morning he was at the pool early, and at
his first cast hooked something heavy and commenced to draw it up. When the hook appeared
above water there was a gold chain attached <span class="pageNum" id="pb566">[<a href="#pb566">566</a>]</span>to it. The lucky fisherman then commenced to pull up the chain into his canoe, and
hauled up fathoms of it, hand over hand, until the boat could hardly hold any more.
Just then a little bird alighted on a branch close by and piped out a couple of notes,
which sounded for all the world like <i lang="ms">kachip</i>. The man heard, but he wanted a little more, and he went on hauling. ‘<i lang="ms">Kachip</i>,’ said the bird again. ‘Just a very little more,’ thought the fisherman, and he still
continued dragging up the chain. Again and again the warning note sounded, but in
vain, and suddenly a strong pull from the bottom of the pool dragged back the chain,
and before the Malay had time to divide it with his tweezers, the last link of it
had disappeared beneath the water.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27732src" href="#xd32e27732">250</a>

<h4 class="main"><i>Charms, Talismans, and Witchcraft</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While by divination and by inferences from omens and dreams, Malays attempt to ascertain
the course of fate, so by charms of the nature of amulets and talismans they sometimes
endeavour to influence its direction or modify its force. Charms of the nature of
invocations have been dealt with already under different headings in connection with
a variety of matters, and it will only be necessary to refer here to a few miscellaneous
ones of a less elaborate character. It should be observed that some charms are directly
effective or protective, like amulets or talismans, while others are supposed to work
only by influencing the volition of another mind. Under the latter head come the great
mass of love-charms, charms for securing conjugal fidelity, or for compelling the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb567">[<a href="#pb567">567</a>]</span>revelation by another person of his or her secret thoughts, and the like, of which
Malay books of magic are full; while under the former come sundry recipes of a more
or less medicinal nature for the purpose of curing various diseases, of increasing
physical power or virility, or of protecting the person against evil influences, natural
or supernatural. In most of these cases the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> is of the simplest character; the charm consists usually of a short Arabic prayer
or a few letters and figures, sometimes quite meaningless and conventional, sometimes
making up one or more of the sacred names (Allah, Muhammad, ʿAli, etc.). These charms
are written on paper or cloth and worn on the person; sometimes they are written on
the body itself, especially on the part to be affected; occasionally they are written
on a cup which is then used for drinking purposes. Such prescriptions are infinite
in number, and are to be found in Malay charm-books, wedged in amongst matter of a
more strictly medical kind; in fact, it would be quite correct to say that letter-charms
(<i lang="ms">rajah</i>, <i lang="ms">ʿazimat</i>) and sacred names have their place in the Malay Pharmacopœia side by side with spices,
herbs, roots, and the like. But such charms are also used for many other purposes:
“to ward off demons (<i lang="ms">sheitan</i>), to make children feed at the breast properly, to prevent them from crying and from
going into convulsions, to prevent the rice-crops from being devoured by pigs, rats,
and maggots,” are consecutive instances of the charms contained in a page of one of
the numerous Malay treatises on these matters. It would, from the nature of the case,
be utterly impossible to exhaust this endless subject, and it is not necessary to
dwell upon it at greater length, as the details of the charms used (of which a <span class="pageNum" id="pb568">[<a href="#pb568">568</a>]</span>few are quoted in the Appendix) do not as a rule offer any features of general interest.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27758src" href="#xd32e27758">251</a>
</p>
<p>Far more interesting is that form of the Black Art which attempts to “abduct,” or
in some way “get at” another person’s soul, whether (as in the case of the ordinary
love-charm), in order to influence it in the operator’s favour, or, on the other hand,
with a view to doing the victim some harm, which may take the form of madness, disease,
or even death.
</p>
<p>These results can be arrived at by a variety of methods: in some of them the influence
works entirely without contact, in others there is some sort of contact between the
victim and the receptacle into which his soul is to be enticed. A few specimens of
the methods employed will conclude this part of the subject; they are necessarily
somewhat of a miscellaneous character; but it will be seen that they are really only
different applications of the same general principle, the nature of which has already
been indicated in the section on the Soul.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27764src" href="#xd32e27764">252</a>
</p>
<p>The following is an instance of direct contact between the soul receptacle and its
owner’s body—
</p>
<p>“Take soil from the centre of the footprint (<i lang="ms">hati-hati tapak</i>) of the person you wish to charm, and ‘treat it ceremonially’ (<i lang="ms">di-puja</i>) for about three days.
</p>
<p>“The ‘ceremonial treatment’ consists in wrapping it up in pieces of red, black, and
yellow cloth<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27783src" href="#xd32e27783">253</a> (the <span class="pageNum" id="pb569">[<a href="#pb569">569</a>]</span>yellow being outside), and hanging it from the centre of your mosquito-curtain with
parti-coloured thread (<i lang="ms">pĕnggantong-nya bĕnang pancharona</i>). It will then become (the domicile of) your victim’s soul (<i lang="ms">jadi sĕmangat</i>). You must, however, to complete the ceremony, switch it with a birch of seven leaf-ribs
taken from a ‘green’ cocoa-nut (<i lang="ms">pĕnyembat-nya lidi niyor hijau tujoh ’lei</i>) seven times at sundown, seven times at midnight, and seven times at sunrise, continuing
this for three days, and saying as you do so:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">“ ‘It is not earth that I switch,
</p>
<p class="line">But the heart of <i>So-and-so</i>.’
</p>
</div>
<div lang="ms" class="lg">
<p class="line">(<i>Bukan-nya aku mĕnyembat tanah,</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i>Aku mĕnyembat hati</i> Si Anu).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">“Then bury it in the middle of a path where your victim is sure to step over it (<i lang="ms">supaya buleh di-langkah-nya</i>), and he will certainly become distraught. The only taboo in connection with it is
that you should let no one share your sleeping-mat.” The soul-receptacle in this case
is the lump of earth taken from the centre of the victim’s footprint. It is said to
actually “become (the victim’s) soul,” but no doubt this is merely figurative, though
it completely proves the identification of the soul with its receptacle in the Malay
mind. The object of the birching is not self-evident, but may be intended to dispel
evil influences, and so purify it for the incoming soul.
</p>
<p>Another way of obtaining the required result is to scrape off some of the wood of
the floor from the place where your intended victim has been sitting. Having secured
this, take some of the soil from his or her footprint and mix them both together with
wax from a deserted bees’ comb, moulding the figure into his <span class="pageNum" id="pb570">[<a href="#pb570">570</a>]</span>or her likeness. Fumigate it with incense, and “beckon” to the soul by waving a cloth
(<i lang="ms">lambei sĕmangat</i>) every night for three nights successively, reciting this charm:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“ ‘OM!’ shout it again and again!
</p>
<p class="line">Stupid and dazed
</p>
<p class="line">Be the heart of <i>Somebody</i>,
</p>
<p class="line">Thinking of me.
</p>
<p class="line">If you do not think of me,
</p>
<p class="line">The forty-four angels shall curse you.”</p>

</p>
<p><i>Page 570.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Another method is as follows:—
</p>
<p>Take parings of nails, hair, eyebrows, saliva, etc. of your intended victim (sufficient
to represent every part of his person), and make them up into his likeness with wax
from a deserted bees’ comb. Scorch the figure slowly by holding it over a lamp every
night for seven nights, and say:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“It is not wax that I am scorching,
</p>
<p class="line">It is the liver, heart, and spleen of <i>So-and-so</i> that I scorch.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">After the seventh time burn the figure, and your victim will die.
</p>
<p>The description of the next ceremony is taken word for word from a charm-book which
I obtained from a Langat Malay (named ’Che Indut), and which is still in my possession.
As it illustrates several new points about these wax figures, and as such charms are
exceedingly rare and all but impossible to obtain, I here give a word for word translation
of the whole text, the original Malay version of which will be found in the Appendix:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27873src" href="#xd32e27873">254</a>—
</p>
<p>“This refers to making images to harm people. You make an image to resemble a corpse
out of wax <span class="pageNum" id="pb571">[<a href="#pb571">571</a>]</span>from an empty bees’ comb,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27884src" href="#xd32e27884">255</a> and of the length of a footstep. If you want to cause sickness, you pierce the eye
and blindness results; or you pierce the waist and the stomach (lit. the waist) gets
sick, or you pierce the head and the head gets sick, or you pierce the breast and
the breast gets sick. If you want to cause death, you transfix it from the head right
through to the buttocks, the ‘transfixer’ being a <i lang="ms">gomuti</i>-palm<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27890src" href="#xd32e27890">256</a> twig; then you enshroud the image as you would a corpse, and you pray over it as
if you were praying over the dead; then you bury it in the middle of the path (which
goes to) the place of the person whom you wish to charm, so that he may step across
it. This refers to when you want to bury the image—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be to you! Ho, Prophet ’Tap, in whose charge the earth is,
</p>
<p class="line">Lo, I am burying the corpse of <i>Somebody</i>,
</p>
<p class="line">I am bidden (to do so) by the Prophet Muhammad,
</p>
<p class="line">Because he (the corpse) was a rebel to God.
</p>
<p class="line">Do you assist in killing him or making him sick:
</p>
<p class="line">If you do not make him sick, if you do not kill him,
</p>
<p class="line">You shall be a rebel against God,
</p>
<p class="line">A rebel against Muhammad.
</p>
<p class="line">It is not I who am burying him,
</p>
<p class="line">It is Gabriel who is burying him.
</p>
<p class="line">Do you too grant my prayer and petition, this very day that has appeared,
</p>
<p class="line">Grant it by the grace of my petition within the fold of the Creed <i lang="ms">La ilaha</i>,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">There are, as I have said, several new points to be got from this charm. You must
make the image resemble a corpse; you must make it of the length of the footstep (doubtless
that of the intended victim); <span class="pageNum" id="pb572">[<a href="#pb572">572</a>]</span>you must pierce the part which you want to affect; if you want to kill your man, you
must transfix him from the head downwards with the twig of a <i lang="ms">gomuti</i>-palm (that is to say, with one of the black splinters used as pens by the Malays<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27930src" href="#xd32e27930">257</a>); you must <i>wrap the image in a shroud, and read the burial service over it</i>; and, finally, in order to absolve yourself from blood-guiltiness, you shift the
burden of your crime on to the shoulders of the Archangel Gabriel!!!
</p>
<p>There are, of course, many slight variations of the actual ceremony. Sometimes the
wizard, during the insertion of the pins into the image, exclaims:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“It is not wax that I slay<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27945src" href="#xd32e27945">258</a>
</p>
<p class="line">But the liver, heart, and spleen of <i>So-and-so</i>.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And then, after “waving” the figure in the smoke of the incense, and depositing it
in the centre of a sacrificial tray (<i>anchak</i>), he invites the spirits to banquet upon his victim’s body:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“I do not banquet you upon anything else,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e27968src" href="#xd32e27968">259</a>
</p>
<p class="line">But on the liver, heart, and spleen of <i>So-and-so</i>.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When the ceremony is over the image is buried in the usual way in front of the victim’s
door-step.
</p>
<p>Another method is described as follows:—
</p>
<p>“Make the wax figure in the usual way and with the usual ingredients. At sundown take
parched rice, with white, black, green, and yellow (saffron) rice, a “chew” of betel-leaf,
a wax taper and an egg—this latter as the representative of a fowl (<i lang="ms">ʿisharat ayam</i>). Burn incense, and recite this charm:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb573">[<a href="#pb573">573</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Peace be with you, O Earth Genie,
</p>
<p class="line">Bull-shaped Earth-spirit, Earth-demon, Bull-shaped World-spirit.
</p>
<p class="line">Come hither, come down, I pray you, and accept the banquet I offer.
</p>
<p class="line">I have a something that I want you for,

</div>
<p class="first">This is a charm for sowing dissension between husband and wife (<i lang="ms">pĕmbĕnchi</i>):—
</p>
<p>Make two of the wax figures in the ordinary way, but taking care that one resembles
the husband and the other the wife. Sit down with your legs stretched out before you,
and hold the figures face to face while you repeat the charm thrice, and at the end
of each repetition breathe upon their heads. Then lay the man upon the ground on your
right side close to your thigh, but looking away from it; and the woman at the side
of the left thigh in a similar position, so that they both look away from each other.
Then burn incense and recite the same charm twenty-two times over the man and twenty-two
times over the woman. Now put them back to back, and wrap them up in seven thicknesses
of the leaves of <i lang="ms">tukas</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e28035src" href="#xd32e28035">260</a> and tie them round with thread of seven colours wrapped seven times round them, repeat
the charm and bury them. Dig them up after seven days and see if they are still there.
If you find them the charm has failed, but if not, it will work, and they will assuredly
be divorced. The charm runs as follows:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb574">[<a href="#pb574">574</a>]</span></p>
<div lang="ms" class="lgouter xd32e2490">
<p class="line">“’Ndit marangan ’ndit!

<p class="line">Muhammad in very truth is the Chief,
</p>
<p class="line">The Tiger of God upon earth.
</p>
<p class="line">By the grace of,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The following is a clear example of soul abduction without contact:—
</p>
<p>The simplest way, perhaps, of abducting another person’s soul is to go out, when the
sun clears (<i lang="ms">matahari mĕncharak</i>, at sunrise?), or when the newly-risen moon looks red, and standing with the big
toe of the right foot resting on the big toe of the left, to make a trumpet of your
right hand and recite the appropriate charm through this improvised speaking-trumpet
thrice. At the end of each recital you blow through the hollowed fist. The charm runs
as follows:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“ ‘OM.’ I loose my shaft, I loose it and the moon clouds over,
</p>
<p class="line">I loose it, and the sun is extinguished,
</p>
<p class="line">I loose it, and the stars burn dim.
</p>
<p class="line">But it is not the sun, moon, and stars that I shoot at,
</p>
<p class="line">It is the stalk of the heart of that child of the congregation, <i>So-and-so</i>.
</p>
<p class="line">Cluck! cluck! soul of <i>So-and-so</i>, come and walk with me,
</p>
<p class="line">Come and sit with me,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb575">[<a href="#pb575">575</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Come and sleep and share my pillow.
</p>
<p class="line">Cluck! cluck! soul,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A second method is to beat your own shadow,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e28088src" href="#xd32e28088">261</a> ceremonially; according to this method you take a cane (of rattan or <i lang="ms">rotan sĕga</i>), in length as long as your body, fumigate it with incense and recite a charm over
it seven times, <i>striking your own shadow with the cane once after each recital</i>. Repeat this at sundown, midnight, and early morning, and sleep under a coverlet
made of five cubits of white cloth, and the soul you wish for will assuredly come
to you. The following is the charm, a very curious one:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Ho! Irupi, Shadowy One,
</p>
<p class="line">Let the Queen come to me.
</p>
<p class="line">Do you, if <i>Somebody</i> is awake,
</p>
<p class="line">Stir her and shake her, and make her rise,
</p>
<p class="line">And take her breath and her soul and bring them here,
</p>
<p class="line">And deposit them in my left side.
</p>
<p class="line">But if she sleep,
</p>
<p class="line">Do you take hold of the great toe of her right foot
</p>
<p class="line">Until you can make her get up,
</p>
<p class="line">And use your utmost endeavours to bring them to me.
</p>
<p class="line">If you do not, you shall be a rebel to God,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Another method of abducting another person’s soul is as follows:—
</p>
<p>“Take a lime branch which has seven limes on a single stalk, and suspend it from the
top of your <span class="pageNum" id="pb576">[<a href="#pb576">576</a>]</span>mosquito-curtain on three successive nights. When you suspend it recite the charm
already given<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e28123src" href="#xd32e28123">262</a> (beginning ‘Om! shout it again and again!’).”
</p>
<p>The following ceremony is one in which the soul of another person is abducted without
any direct contact between the soul-receptacle, which in this case is a head-cloth,
and the soul-owner. The directions are as follows:—
</p>
<p>“Go out on the fourteenth night of the lunar month (full moon) and two successive
nights; seat yourself on a male ant-hill (<i lang="ms">busut jantan</i>) facing the moon, burn incense, and repeat the charm:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“I bring you a (betel-) leaf to chew,
</p>
<p class="line">Dab the lime on to it, Prince Ferocious,
</p>
<p class="line">For <i>Somebody</i>, Prince Distraction’s daughter, to chew.
</p>
<p class="line"><i>Somebody</i> at sunrise be distraught for love of me,
</p>
<p class="line"><i>Somebody</i> at sunset be distraught for love of me.
</p>
<p class="line">As you remember your parents, remember me,
</p>
<p class="line">As you remember your house and house-ladder, remember me.
<p class="tb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
</p>
<p class="line">When thunder rumbles, remember me,
</p>
<p class="line">When wind whistles, remember me,
</p>
<p class="line">When the heavens rain, remember me,
</p>
<p class="line">When cocks crow, remember me,
</p>
<p class="line">When the dial-bird tells its tales, remember me,
</p>
<p class="line">When you look up at the sun, remember me,
</p>
<p class="line">When you look up at the moon, remember me,
</p>
<p class="line">For in that self-same moon I am there.
</p>
<p class="line">Cluck! cluck! soul of <i>Somebody</i> come hither to me,
</p>
<p class="line">I do not mean to let you have my soul,
</p>
<p class="line">Let your soul come hither to mine.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here wave the end of your head-cloth (<i lang="ms">puncha detar</i>) in the direction of the moon seven times every night for three successive nights.
Then take the turban (<i lang="ms">detar</i>) home and place it under your pillow <span class="pageNum" id="pb577">[<a href="#pb577">577</a>]</span>(for the three nights). If you want to use it by day, burn incense, and say:—

<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>It will be noticed that a general similarity underlies these several methods of soul-abduction
in spite of their apparent variety, and the diversity of the objects in view in the
different cases. On this point it is impossible to enlarge here: the purpose of this
book has been primarily to collect authentic specimens of the various magic practices
in vogue among the Malays of the Malay Peninsula, and to indicate the nature of the
beliefs on which these practices are based, leaving it for others to draw from them
such inferences and to make such comparisons as may throw further light on the subject.
It has not been deemed desirable to anticipate such inferences and comparisons here;
but, without trespassing beyond the scope of the present work, it may be noticed that
there is a special appropriateness in concluding it with the above account of the
various methods of soul-abduction. From them, taken together with what has already
been said on the subject,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e28278src" href="#xd32e28278">264</a> a fairly complete idea can be gathered of the Malay conception of the Soul; and it
is hardly too much to say that this conception is the central feature of the whole
system of Malay magic and folklore, from which all the different branches with their
various applications appear to spring.
</p>
<p>The root-idea seems to be an all-pervading Animism, involving a certain common vital
principle (<i lang="ms">sĕmangat</i>) in Man and Nature, which, for want of a more suitable word, has been here called
the Soul. The application of this general theory of the universe <span class="pageNum" id="pb580">[<a href="#pb580">580</a>]</span>to the requirements of the individual man constitutes the Magic Art, which, as conceived
by the Malays, may be said to consist of the methods by which this Soul, whether in
gods, men, animals, vegetables, minerals, or what not, may be influenced, captured,
subdued, or in some way made subject to the will of the magician.
</p>
<p>It would, however, probably be a mistake to push this analysis too far; for side by
side with the theory of a universe animated by souls, which by the use of the appropriate
words and forms can be cajoled or threatened, there are the ideas of Luck and Ill-luck,
and the notion, strong in Muhammadans all over the world, of a preordained course
of events. Sometimes, presumably in extreme cases, there is no escape from this destiny:
if a man is fated to die at a certain time, die he must, whatever he may do. But to
a great extent ill-luck can be avoided if one knows how; though we cannot stop it,
we need not expose ourselves to its influence. Thus a particular hour may be unlucky
for the doing of a certain act; but if we know that it is so, we need not incur the
danger.
</p>
<p>There are, therefore, for a Malay three alternatives, it would seem: viz. Charms,
for occasions where moral pressure can be brought to bear; Divination, to assist in
detecting dangers which in the ordinary course must come but can be avoided; and,
finally, Islām (Resignation), when he has to meet the inevitable, whether it be regarded
as the course of Fate or the eternal purpose of God.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e15569src">1</a></span> “To return to the elemental spirits, it was explained to me by a Malay, with whom
I discussed the subject at leisure, that apart from the spirits which are an object
of reverence, and which when treated with proper deference are usually beneficent,
there are a variety of others. To begin with, spirits (the word used on this occasion
was <i lang="ms">hantu</i>) are of at least two kinds—wild ones, whose normal habitat is the jungle, and those
that are, so to say, domesticated. The latter, which seem to correspond to what in
Western magic are called ‘familiars,’ vary in character with their owners or the persons
to whom they are attached. Thus in this particular village of Bukit Sĕnggeh, a few
years ago, there was a good deal of alarm on account of the arrival of two or three
strangers believed to be of bad character, who were supposed to keep a familiar spirit
of a peculiarly malignant disposition, which was in the habit of attacking people
in their sleep by throttling them. One or two cases of this kind occurred, and it
was seriously suggested that I should make the matter the subject of a magisterial
inquiry, which, however, I did not find it necessary to do. But the familiar spirits
are by no means necessarily evil.… The chief point of importance is to keep these
wild spirits in their proper place, viz. the jungle, and to prevent them taking up
their abode in the villages. For this reason charms are hung up at the borders of
the villages, and whenever a wild spirit breaks bounds and encroaches on human habitations
it is necessary to get him turned out.”—Blagden in <i>J.R.A.S.</i>, <i>S.B.</i> No. 29, p. 4.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e15569src" title="Return to note 1 in text.">↑</a></p>

It is usually believed by Malays that the <i lang="ms">Bajang</i> is merely a malignant spirit which haunts mankind, and whose presence foretells disaster.
In Perak and some other parts of the Peninsula, however, the <i lang="ms">Bajang</i> is regarded as one of the several kinds of demons which, the Malays hold, can be
enslaved by man and become his familiar spirit. Such familiars, it is believed, are
handed down in certain families as heirlooms. The master of the familiar is said to
keep it imprisoned in a <i lang="ms">tabong</i>, or vessel made from a joint of the bamboo, which is closed by a stopper made from
the leaves of the <i lang="la">Cotyledon laciniata</i>, the <i lang="ms">Daun chĕkar bebek</i>, or <i lang="ms">Daun sadingin</i>, as they are variously termed by the Malays. Both the case and the stopper are prepared
by certain magic arts before they can be employed in this way. The familiar is fed
with eggs and milk. When its master wishes to make use of it he sends it forth to possess
and prey upon the vitals of any one whom his malice may select as a victim. The individual
thus persecuted is at once seized by a deadly and unaccountable ailment, which can
only be cured by magic agencies. If the <i lang="ms">Bajang</i> is neglected by its owner, and if the latter omits to feed it regularly, it is said
that he often falls a victim to his own familiar.”—Clifford and Swett., <i>Mal. Dic.</i>, <i>s.v.</i> Bajang.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e15609src" title="Return to note 4 in text.">↑</a></p>

and who comes to torment small children in the guise of a fearful face and bust, with
many feet of bloody, trailing entrails in her wake.”—Clifford, <i>loc. cit.</i>

<p class="footnote cont">“He (Mr. M.) said, ‘Very well then, tell me about the <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i> only, I should like to hear it and to write it down in English so that Europeans
may know how foolish those persons are who believe in such things.’ I then drew a
picture representing a woman’s head and neck only, with the intestines hanging down.
Mr. M. caused this to be engraved on wood by a Chinese, and inserted it with the story
belonging to it in a publication called the <i>Anglo-Chinese Gleaner</i>. And I said, ‘Sir, listen to the account of the <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i>. It was originally a woman. She used the magic arts of a devil in whom she believed,
and she devoted herself to his service night and day until the period of her agreement
with her teacher had expired and she was able to fly. Her head and neck were then
loosened from the body, the intestines being attached to them, and hanging down in
strings. The body remained where it was. Wherever the person whom it was wished to
injure happened to live, thither flew the head and bowels to suck his blood, and the
person whose blood was sucked was sure to die. If the blood and water which dripped
from the intestines touched any person, serious illness immediately followed and his
body broke out in open sores. The <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i> likes to suck the blood of women in childbirth. For this reason it is customary at
all houses where a birth occurs to hang up <i lang="ms">jeruju</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15828src" href="#xd32e15828">11</a> leaves at the doors and windows, or to place thorns wherever there is any blood,
lest the <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i> should come and suck it, for the <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i> has, it seems, a dread of thorns in which her intestines may happen to get caught.
It is said that a <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i> once came to a man’s house in the middle of the night to suck his blood, and her
intestines were caught in some thorns near the hedge, and she had to remain there
until daylight, when the people saw and killed her.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“ ‘The person who has the power of becoming a <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i> always keeps at her house a quantity of vinegar in a jar or vessel of some kind.
The use of this is to soak the intestines in, for when they issue forth from the body
they immediately swell up and cannot be put back, but after being soaked in vinegar
they shrink to their former size and enter the body again. There are many people who
have seen the <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i> flying along with its entrails dangling down and shining at night like fire-flies.

in a bottle (<i lang="ms">buli-buli</i>, a bottle having a spherical or wide body and a long narrow neck). Then prayers are
said over it, and something or other is read, I don’t know what, but it has to be
learnt. After seven days of this worship, according to some people, or after twice
seven days according to others, a sound is heard in the bottle like the chirping of young birds. The operator then cuts his finger and
inserts it into the bottle and the Polong sucks it. The person who thus supports the
Polong is called his father, or, if it happens to be a woman, she is his mother. Every
day the parent feeds it with his (or her) blood. The object of doing this and the
advantage to be gained from it are these:—if he entertains a feeling of anger against
any one he orders the Polong to go and afflict him, that is to say, to cause him pain
or sickness; or if a third person is at enmity with another he goes in secret to the
person who keeps the Polong, and gives him a sum of money to send the Polong to attack
the person against whom he bears ill-will. This is the use of it. The person who is
tormented by the Polong, whether a virgin, or a married woman, or a man, cries out
and loses consciousness of what he (or she) is doing, and tears and throws off his
(or her) clothing, biting and striking the people near, blind and deaf to everything,
and does all sorts of other things. Wise men are called in to prescribe remedies;
some come and chant formulas over the head of the patient, others pinch his thumb
and apply medicines to it. When the remedy is successful the sick person cries out,
‘Let me go, I want to go home.’ The doctor replies, ‘I will not let you go if you
do not make known who it is that has sent you here, and why you have come, and who
are your father and mother.’ Sometimes he (the Polong in the patient) remains silent
and will not confess or give the names of his parents; sometimes he confesses, and
says ‘Let me go, my father is such-a-one and lives at such-and-such a <i lang="ms">kampong</i>, and my mother is so-and-so. The reason that I have come here is that such-a-one
came to my parents and asked for their aid, and gave them a sum of money because he
bore ill-will against this person’ (or whatever the reason may have been). Sometimes
he makes a false statement, and mentions entirely wrong persons in order to conceal
the names of his parents. As soon as the people know the name of the person who has
contrived the attack and the reason, they let him go, and the sick person at once
recovers his consciousness, but he is left weak and feeble. When a Polong attacks
a person and will confess nothing, the person who is attacked shrieks and yells in
anger, and after a day or two he dies. After death blood pours forth bubbling (<i lang="ms">ber-kopak-kopak</i>) from the mouth, and the whole body is blue with bruises.”—<i>Hikayat Abdullah</i>, p. 143.

back to the moon, and your face to an ant-hill, so that your shadow falls on the ant-hill.
Then you recite certain <i lang="ms">jampi</i> (incantations), and bending forward try to embrace your shadow. If you fail, try
again several times, repeating more incantations. If not successful, go the next night
and make a further effort, and the night after, if necessary—three nights in all.
If you cannot then catch your shadow, wait till the same day on the following month
and renew the attempt. Sooner or later you will succeed, and, as you stand there in
the brilliance of the moonlight, you will see that you have drawn your shadow into
yourself, and your body will never again cast a shade. Go home, and in the night,
whether sleeping or waking, the form of a child will appear before you and put out
its tongue; that seize, and it will remain while the rest of the child disappears.
In a little while the tongue will turn into something that breathes, a small animal,
reptile, or insect, and when you see the creature has life put it in a bottle and
the <i lang="ms">pĕlsit</i> is yours.’

bound to attend the patient whenever she may be called upon to do so, and when the
confinement is over she can claim other moneys in payment of her services. These latter
fees are not ruinously high, according to our standard, two dollars being charged
for attending a woman in her first confinement, a dollar or a dollar and a half on
the next occasion, and twenty-five, or at the most fifty cents being deemed sufficient
for each subsequent event.”—Clifford, <i>Studies in Brown Hum.</i>, pp. 47, 48.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e16558src" title="Return to note 29 in text.">↑</a></p>

teeth, which are naturally very white and beautiful, from the simplicity of their
food. For files they make use of small whetstones, and the patients lie on their backs
during the operation. Many, particularly the women of the Lampong country, have their
teeth rubbed down quite even with the gums; others have them formed in points, and
some file off no more than the outer coat and extremities in order that they may the
better receive and retain the jetty blackness with which they almost universally adorn
them. The black used on these occasions is the empyreumatic oil of the cocoa-nut shell.
When this is not applied the filing does not, by destroying what we term the enamel,
diminish the whiteness of the teeth.… The great men sometimes set theirs in gold by
casing with a plate of that metal the under row; and this ornament, contrasted with
the black dye, has, by lamp or candle light, a very splendid effect. It is sometimes
indented to the shape of the teeth, but more usually quite plain. They do not remove
it either to eat or sleep.”—Marsden, <i>Hist. of Sumatra</i> (ed. 1811), pp. 52, 53.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e17256src" title="Return to note 45 in text.">↑</a></p>

the married state with reference to one of the parties only, however, are in frequent
use: such as the <i lang="ms">bĕrsuami</i> and <i lang="ms">bĕristri</i> of the higher classes, and the <i lang="ms">bĕrlaki</i> and <i lang="ms">bĕrbini</i> of the common people; and yet again there is the word <i lang="ms">bĕrumah-rumah</i>, which is applied indifferently to either of the two parties or to both, and is the
politest word that can be used with reference to the common people, but is never applied
to Rajas, in whose case <i lang="ms">bĕrsuami</i> and <i lang="ms">bĕristri</i> alone are used.

it from decay or to keep it pure. No coffin is made use of, the body being simply
wrapped in white cloth, particularly of the sort called <i lang="ms">hummums</i>. In forming the grave (<i lang="ms">kubur</i>), after digging to a convenient depth they make a cavity in the side, at bottom,
of sufficient dimensions to contain the body, which is there deposited on its right
side. By this mode the earth literally lies light upon it; and the cavity, after strewing
flowers in it, they stop up by two boards fastened angularly to each other, so that
the one is on the top of the corpse, whilst the other defends it on the open side,
the edge resting on the bottom of the grave. The outer excavation is then filled up
with earth; and little white flags, or streamers, are stuck in order around. They
likewise plant a shrub, bearing a white flower, called <i lang="ms">kumbangkamboja</i> (<i lang="la">Plumeria obtusa</i>), and in some places wild marjoram. The women who attend the funeral make a hideous
noise, not much unlike the Irish howl. On the third and seventh day the relations
perform a ceremony at the grave, and at the end of twelve months that of <i lang="ms">tegga batu</i>, or setting up a few long elliptical stones, at the head and foot, which, being scarce
in some parts of the country, bear a considerable price. On this occasion they kill

converted to the faith. They are held in extraordinary reverence, and the least disturbance

better foundation than the relation of the numbers to that of the fingers of the hand.
The names of the days of this week are as follows:—<i lang="ms">Lăggi</i>, <i lang="ms">Pahing</i>, <i lang="ms">Pon</i>, <i lang="ms">Wagi</i>, <i lang="ms">Kliwon</i>.… The Javanese consider the names of the days of their native week to have a mystical

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e28088src">261</a></span> The explanation of this ceremony is that the shadow is supposed in some way to embody
or at least represent the soul. Thus the female reapers of the first ripe <i lang="ms">padi</i> are specially enjoined to reap in a straight line facing the sun, so that their shadow
may not fall upon the rice-soul in the basket at their sides (<i>vide</i> pp. 242–244, <i>supra</i>). No doubt the speaker’s shadow-soul is expected to fetch the woman’s body-soul,
and the beating of the shadow-soul is perhaps purely ceremonial, to drive away evil
influences from it, before it starts on its journey, but this latter suggestion is
merely conjectural. The first line of the charm, however, in which the speaker addresses
his shadow by name (Irupi) as he strikes it with the cane, points out most clearly
the connection between the body-soul (or puppet-soul) and the shadow-soul, to which
I have referred. The coverlet or white cloth is no doubt the soul-cloth, into which
the woman’s soul is expected to enter when it arrives.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e28088src" title="Return to note 261 in text.">↑</a></p>

one coolie is waking another, he does so with the greatest gentleness, calling him
softly by his name in an ever varying tone until he has succeeded in awaking him.
Rajas and Chiefs are never aroused until they wake naturally. The European passion
of being called in the morning is regarded by the Malays as only one more symptom

<p class="first">The treatment of the umbilical cord is generally somewhat as follows:—The cord is
rubbed with dust between the finger tips (<i lang="ms">di-gentil dengan abu</i>), and kneaded towards the child (<i lang="ms">di-urut-nya kapada budak</i>), the words “<i lang="ms">Bismillah wadi mari kamari</i>” being pronounced at the same moment. Then it is tied round with strips of the wild
bread-fruit bark (<i lang="ms">tali trap</i>) in seven places, each a thumb’s breadth from the next (<i lang="ms">pengukor ibu tangan</i>). Saffron (turmeric) and a piece of charcoal (<i lang="ms">arang saketut</i>) are now laid upon a coin,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e34318src" href="#xd32e34318">9</a> over which the cord is drawn tightly; and, finally, the cord is severed at a point
between the second and third bindings, by means of a splinter (<i lang="ms">sembilu</i>) of bamboo. The severed ends are now cooled with betel-leaf water (<i lang="ms">di-jelum dengan ayer sirih</i>), rubbed with pounded garlic mixed with fine dust (<i lang="ms">bawang puteh di-giling-nya dengan hati abu</i>), plugged with a roasted peppercorn<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e34330src" href="#xd32e34330">10</a> and covered (<i lang="ms">di-tekup</i>) with <i lang="ms">mengkudu</i> leaves, after which the child is swaddled (<i lang="ms">di-bedong</i>). Within from three to seven days the dead end of the cord will fall off (<i lang="ms">tanggal tali pusat</i>), and the pepper which had previously been inserted will be poured out (<i lang="ms">di-chichir</i>). The caul (<i lang="ms">uri</i>) is deposited in a small rice-bag (<i lang="ms">sumpit</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e34358src" href="#xd32e34358">11</a> with salt, black pepper, and <i lang="ms">asam gelugor</i>. The bag is then tied up and roasted in a split stick (<i lang="ms">sepit</i>) such as is used for cooking fish. After this it is dried by being kept near the
fire in the back premises (where it is subjected from time to time to the <i lang="ms">sembor sirih</i> treatment). When the child can walk, the <i>uri</i> is buried in a hole in the ground, with the nail, candle-nut, brazil-wood, etc.,
mentioned elsewhere.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e34376src" href="#xd32e34376">12</a> In this case a cocoa-nut is usually planted to mark the spot where it was buried.
Sometimes, however, the bag with its contents is merely thrown into the nearest river
or the sea.

<p class="first"><i>Another method of “water-gazing,” by looking into a cup containing saliva produced
by chewing betel</i>
</p>
<p>The directions for this ceremony run as follows:—
</p>
<p>Get (preferably) a woman (or failing a woman, a man), to chew up for you three “chews”
of betel-leaf (betel-leaf with meeting leaf-ribs (<i>sirih bertĕmu urat</i>) is the best). Receive the saliva in a cup and cover it over with a betel-leaf. Fumigate
it with incense and then remove the covering, and “gaze” at it (<i>tilek</i>) intently. The following are the signs which you must look for:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">(1) If it looks yellowish it shows that the patient has been affected by rain in the
heat of the day.
</p>
<p lang="ms">(<i>Kalau rĕchak-rechak kuning rupa chahia-nya, kena hujan panas.</i>)
</p>
<p>(2) If it is pitted (with hollows) it shows that the patient has been affected by
a stopped-up well or buffalo-wallow.
</p>
<p lang="ms">(<i>Kalau rupa berlubok-lubok, kena prigi buta atau kubangan.</i>)
</p>
<p>(3) If it has long streaks running right through it, it shows that the patient has
been affected by the Heart of Wood.
</p>
<p lang="ms">(<i>Kalau rupa-nya berurat panjang terjantang ayer sirih-nya, kena tĕras ada-nya.</i>)
</p>
<p>(4) If round, he has been affected by a hidden tree-stump.
</p>
<p lang="ms">(<i>Kalau rupa-nya bulat, kena tunggul buta.</i>)
</p>
<p>(5) If frothy, he has been affected by an ant-hill.
</p>
<p lang="ms">(<i>Kalau ada buih, kena busut</i><span class="corr" id="xd32e35438" title="Source: ).">.)</span>
</p>
<p>(6) If you see in it anything that resembles cloth or a ring, it is a soul which has
done it.
</p>
<p lang="ms">(<i>Kalau rupa-nya ada kain atau chinchin, semangat yang buat</i>.)</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Before you commence to “gaze,” recite the following charm:—
</p>
<div lang="ms" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Barang apa yang menyakitkan orang ini,
</p>
<p class="line">’Kau tunjokkan, kalau ada kamudah-mudahan,
</p>
<p class="line">Kalau buatan orang, tunjok de’ kiri,
</p>
<p class="line">Kalau hantu sheitan, benchar-lah ’kau.
</p>
<p class="line">Kalau puaka tunjok de’ kanan.
</p>
<p class="line">Kalau ta’ sarasi, tunjok-lah buih berator melintang matahari.
</p>
<p class="line">Kalau ’kau ta’ tunjokkan, d.s.b.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then perform the ceremony with the three water jars. (<i>Vide</i> p. 410 <i>seqq.</i> of the text.)
</p>
<p><i>N.B.</i>—Another method of using the jars is to take seven jars and fill them with water taken
from seven different streams (<i lang="ms">ayer buyong tujoh buyong, di-ambil deripada tujoh anak sungei</i>). Then get ready (<i lang="ms">kalengkapan-nya</i>) five cubits of white cloth, a mat for sitting on (<i lang="ms">tikar sa-gulong tempat dudok</i>), a birch of seven “green” cocoa-nut twigs (<i lang="ms">lidi niyor hijau tujoh ’lei</i>), and the necessary sorts of rice.
</p>
<p>Now the Pawang summons the spirits as follows:—
</p>
<div lang="ms" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O Jin, Saraja Jin,

<p class="first"><i>Senna</i>.—As an example of the present state of medical science among the Malays, the following
translation of instructions for the use of a well-known drug may be of interest. It
will be seen that it cures as many diseases as some of the patent pills of modern
advertisements. The mention of grapes, dates, and pomegranates as ingredients may
show that the Malay prescription is itself a translation from Indian or Arabic sources:—
</p>
<p>“This is designed to explain the virtues of the senna of Mecca (<i>daun sana-makki</i>), which is famous among all doctors of experience.
</p>
<p>“<i>First</i>. Take some senna leaves with their stalks and bark, pound the whole up fine, and
then weigh out a quantity as heavy as three Java duits. Let this be mixed with honey.
If this is swallowed, its properties are to cause all diseases of the chest to disappear.
</p>
<p>“<i>Second</i>. Mix the senna leaves with moist sugar. If this is taken internally, the effect is
to expel cold from the body and to give strength to the organs.
</p>
<p>“<i>Third</i>. Mix the senna leaves with sugar candy. This gives strength to the bones.
</p>
<p>“<i>Fourth</i>. Mix the senna leaves with clarified butter and moist sugar. If this is taken for
three days it will get rid of all bad humours in the body, and will give health.
</p>
<p>“<i>Fifth</i>. Mix the senna leaves with fresh butter to which no salt has yet been added. The
properties of this mixture are to cure headaches and to cleanse the brain and to remove
any bad taste in the mouth.
</p>
<p>“<i>Sixth</i>. Mix the senna leaves with curds. This mixture operates as an antidote to poison
and prevents evil consequences from it.
</p>
<p>“<i>Seventh</i>. If senna be taken with goat’s milk, it will cause an accession of strength, though
complete weakness existed just before.
</p>
<p>“<i>Eighth</i>. If senna be taken with dates, everything offensive is removed from the mouth, and
the body is made healthy, and a good appetite is established.
</p>
<p>“<i>Ninth</i>. If senna be taken with pomegranates, the body becomes strong, and though the patient
may be old, nevertheless there is an addition of strength, and the organs of the chest
are cleansed, and the appetites are stimulated.
</p>
<p>“<i>Tenth</i>. If senna be taken with grapes, it gives light to the eyes which were dim. This is
proved by experience.
</p>
<p>“<i>Eleventh</i>. If senna be drunk with vinegar, it cures fever accompanied by shivering and trembling
of the bones, and expels all mischief from the stomach, and cleanses the organs of
the chest.
</p>
<p>“<i>Twelfth</i>. If senna leaves be taken with orange juice, all internal heat is removed, and a
man who was before quite thin will speedily grow fat.
</p>
<p>“<i>Thirteenth</i>. If senna is drunk with dew, the eyes become bright and clear.
</p>
<p>“<i>Fourteenth</i>. If senna is taken in water in which pomegranate peel has been boiled, it cures dysentery.
</p>
<p>“<i>Fifteenth</i>. If senna is boiled with cocoa-nut water and taken internally, it will cure diabetes
and gravel, by the will of God ever to be praised and Most High.”
</p>
<p>Thus the properties of the senna of Mecca are concluded under fifteen headings.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e36695src" href="#xd32e36695">52</a>

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">[ccxl]</span> <i>Measurement of K’ris</i> <span class="pref">[p. <a href="#pb530" class="pageref">530</a>.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. Measure the <i lang="ms">k’ris</i> from the bottom of the blade (in the centre) to the point with a thin strip of cocoa-nut
leaf about half an inch wide. Cut the strip to this length and fold it trebly; notch
one of the third parts at the fold; measure off the length of the two remaining thirds
on the blade from the bottom towards the point, and mark the blade at this distance.
Then measure off the remaining third round the blade at this mark as follows:—See
that its extreme end exactly coincides with the left side of the blade, and stretch
it across the blade at right angles, bending the strip of leaf round the edge at the
exact spot reached on the opposite edge of the blade by making a dent but not severing
the leaf. Then measure it a second time from the dent thus made, making a second dent
on the strip at the point reached. Repeat this a third time, making a third dent,
when the dent on the strip of leaf should be found to come exactly in the centre of
the blade, if the blade is a good one.
</p>
<p>If it falls on either side it is bad, and if it requires four measurements (instead
of three) it is very bad, though five would be good. There will never be more than
five.
</p>
<p>This measurement is called the Malay measurement (<i lang="ms">Ukoran Malayu</i>) as distinguished from
</p>
<p>2. The Bugis’ measurement (<i lang="ms">Ukoran Bugis</i>), which is made nearer the hilt, as follows:—Begin as before, but measure off the
remaining two-thirds from the point instead of the hilt. This will give a mark farther
up the blade, and the strip of leaf must then be folded round the <i lang="ms">k’ris</i> to see where the notch (between <span class="pageNum" id="pb655">[<a href="#pb655">655</a>]</span>the second and third divisions) will come on the blade. The number of times which
the breadth of the <i lang="ms">k’ris</i> will go into the third division is now of no importance. Merely measure from the
end of the third division as before, continuing until the notch is right over the
blade. If it comes at the left side of the blade it is good, but if in the centre
or on the right it is unlucky.
</p>
<p>3. Another method, called <i lang="ms">Ukor Toh Mujud Dato’ Lukut</i> (the measurement of Toh Mujud, chief or founder of Lukut), is used especially by
Selangor Malays. The story goes that Toh Mujud’s wife was unfaithful with a Kedah
man, and that her husband, being jealous to desperation, searched everywhere in vain
for a <i lang="ms">k’ris</i> which would settle his adversary. At length, however, in a dream a vision appeared
to him, and told him to look for a <i lang="ms">k’ris sapukal</i> in the possession of a man who was digging up <i lang="ms">rĕmis</i> or <i lang="ms">tepeh</i> (a kind of mollusc?). Toh Mujud went accordingly to look for the man, and on meeting
with one so occupied at Pulau Labuhan Bilek, near Tanjong Tuan, found that he had
a very old and rusty <i lang="ms">k’ris</i>, which he thereupon bought from him for 25 cents. Armed with this <i lang="ms">k’ris</i> Toh Mujud then found and slew his adversary, and the proportions of the lucky weapon
corresponded with the measurement here given.
</p>
<p>Fold the string or strip of leaf, and cut it in half. Take one of the halves, fold
it, and measure from the point upwards as far as it will go. Mark the spot, and measure
off the string in breadths of the <i lang="ms">k’ris</i> at that spot: there must be ten breadths, and at the measuring of the tenth the end
of the string must be in the centre of the blade, if it is to be of any use.
</p>
<p>Then take the other half, fold it also in two, and measure up from the bottom of the
blade as far as the folded string will go: there must be seven breadths of the blade
in the length of the half string, and the end of the string should come within a hair’s-breadth
of the edge of the blade, or, as the Malays say, “leaving space for an ant to pass.”
</p>
<p>4. Another method is known as the <i lang="ms">Ukoran Gĕnap</i>, or <i lang="ms">Ukor Mandar</i> (of Celebes).
</p>
<p>Fold the string in two, and measure off the half-length thus obtained on the blade,
commencing at the bottom. Then see how many times the breadth of the blade is contained
in the whole length of the string, which should be <i>fourteen</i>.
</p>
<p>5. Another way of measuring, to see how many thumbs’-breadths there are in the length
of the blade, is as follows. It is not considered of much importance:—Lay the right
thumb across the foot of the blade near the hilt, and the thumb of the left hand also
on the blade immediately above the other; continue placing the thumbs alternately
one in front of the other until the point is reached, repeating for the first thumb’s-breadth
the word <i lang="ms">gunong</i> (mountain), for the second <i lang="ms">runtoh</i> (fall), for the third <i lang="ms">madu</i> (honey), for the fourth <i lang="ms">sĕgara</i> (ocean), after which recommence with <i lang="ms">gunong</i>, and so on. If <i lang="ms">gunong</i> or <i lang="ms">madu</i> brings the thumb to the point the blade is a good one, but not if it is <i lang="ms">runtoh</i> or <i lang="ms">sĕgara</i>.
</p>
<p>6. Another measurement is thus described:—Put the tip of the right thumb upon the
spot where the hilt joins the blade, with the back of the first joint against the
blade; next to this put the left thumb horizontally across the blade, and continue
to alternate the first joint of the right thumb with the breadth of the left till
the point of the <i>k’ris</i> is reached, repeating as follows:—

This system applies especially to warfare; thus, it is ruinous to approach an enemy
from the point of the compass to which the mouth of the Dragon is pointing, but good
to come from the quarter towards which its back is turned, and so on.

these lines have taken the place of an older invocation now forgotten. Their Arabic

<h2 class="main">NOTE ON THE WORD <i>KRAMAT</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following is an extract from a letter by the author which was received too late
for insertion in the text of the book:—
</p>
<p>“I think that the best translation for <i>kramat</i>, in the case of beasts, etc., is ‘sacred.’ I have been going into the <i>kramat</i> question, and it appears to me that <i>kramat</i> animals, trees, and other objects occupy the same place in Malay popular religion
as is occupied by Totems in the popular religion of other countries.
</p>
<p>“I do not wish to be understood (before going more deeply still into the matter) that
they <i>are</i> totems, but that they possess, generally speaking, the same characteristics. They
are the bodily tenements or receptacles containing the souls of the departed ancestors
of the village. Incense is burnt and prayers are offered to them (<i>e.g.</i> in the case of the sacred elephant), and the mere fact of meeting them when one is
engaged in a difficult enterprise is believed to insure success. On the other hand,
to kill or wound them is to court disaster.”
</p>
<p>To the above I may add that <i>kramat</i> (which is a word of Arabic derivation) properly appears to mean “sanctity,” but is
in Malay generally used adjectively, being applied to men, animals, plants, stones,
etc. When the word stands alone it almost invariably means a holy <i>place</i>, the word <i>tĕmpat</i> being presumably understood. When applied to a person it implies special sanctity
and miraculous power. I remember, in 1895, hearing of a little girl, living with her
parents at Sungei Baru in the Alor Gajah district of Malacca, who was reputed to be
<i>kramat</i>. People used to travel considerable distances in order to visit her, and thereby
gain some benefit or other. I was informed that the <i>modus operandi</i> was to swallow a small quantity of her saliva in a cup of water, but I never verified
this statement. These pilgrimages were rather disapproved of by the local Kathi, who
was my informant.
</p>
<p>As regards true totemism, I am not sure that it can be traced among the Malays of
the Peninsula, although a few elements of the system are to be found here and there
among them. Thus, for instance, in certain districts (<i>e.g.</i> northern Malacca and the Negri Sembilan) there are clans descending in the female
line among whom exogamy is still the rule, to the extent, at least, that intermarriage
is forbidden between the children of sisters (<i>J.R.A.S., S.B.</i>, No. 23, p. 143); and we also sometimes find tutelary or taboo animals, etc. more
or less closely connected with certain families; but these two sets of facts do not
seem to be interwoven as they appear to be among certain other races. Traces of animals,
etc. being regarded as specially connected with particular families are not, I believe,
very common: two instances occur in the <i>Sĕjarah Malayu</i>, viz. the man “Bat’h,” who emerged from foam vomited by a bull (<i>Malay Annals</i>, p. 23), and who is regarded as the progenitor of the still existing Malay tribe
(Bangsa Muntah Lĕmbu) of hereditary bards, to whom beef, milk, etc. are taboo<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e39835src" href="#xd32e39835">1</a>; and the Indian prince “Mani Farendan” (<i>ibid.</i> p. 110), who on his voyage to Malacca <span class="pageNum" id="pb674">[<a href="#pb674">674</a>]</span>was preserved from drowning by the <i lang="ms">alu-alu</i> fish and the <i lang="ms">gandasuli</i> tree, and on that account “forbade all his descendants to eat of the fish <i lang="ms">alu-alu</i> or to wear the flower of the <i lang="ms">gandasuli</i>.” His descendants formed a noble family in Malacca, the heads of which usually bore
the title of <i lang="ms">S’ri Naradiraja</i>, and during the 15th century <span class="sc">A. D.</span> often held the highest offices of state; so the legend may, probably enough, preserve
the record of an actual custom peculiar to that family. Both the above cases, however,
seem to be derived from a Hindu origin.
</p>
<p>The tutelary animals connected with holy (<i lang="ms">kramat</i>) places may perhaps sometimes be in point in this connection: for instance, at Malacca
Pindah, in Malacca territory, I remember seeing the private burial-place of a certain
family (which lived close by), and being informed by the local village headman that,
whenever any member of that family died, certain tigers were in the habit of wailing
(<i lang="ms">mĕnangis</i>) round the place at night.
</p>
<p>It has been observed by the author (pp. 71, 153, 163) that <i>kramat</i> animals generally have some physical peculiarity, such as a shrunken foot or stunted
tusk; it may be added that they are sometimes white (<i>i.e.</i> albino individuals of a species which is not usually white), and thus marked out
from their fellows by the characteristic sacred colour. I remember reading in the
local Straits newspaper some years ago that a white mouse-deer, which was caught somewhere
in the Negri Sembilan, was regarded by the Malays as <i>kramat</i>: very soon after its capture, I believe on the same evening, it escaped from its
cage overnight, a fact which no doubt further corroborated the natives in their belief
as to its sacred character. I have little doubt that it was purposely released by
some superstitious Malay, who thought that no good would come of keeping a sacred
animal in captivity.
