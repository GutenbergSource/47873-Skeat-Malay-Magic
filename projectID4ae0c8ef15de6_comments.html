<HTML><BODY>This anthropological classic describes the magic used on the Malay Peninsula in detail. Numerous Malay words appear in the text, and a lengthy appendix gives the Malay versions of the charms and spells described. Numerous footnotes add further details.

<p>When proofreading this text, you might encounter a few special characters. The characters with a breve (smal bow above) can be transcribed like this: [)e] for 'e with breve'. A few times a macron appears. This can be transcribed thus: [=a].

<p>Careful distinction needs to be made between the ain and the hamzah. The former is like a high turned comma (aka single opening quote), and needs to be represented by a ` (on most keyboards on the top left key), the other looks like an apostrophe, and can be simply typed as a '.

<p>The footnotes are given in two columns. I have manually zoned them in the OCR software for all pages, so they should be in the correct order at the bottom of the page, but please check the order.

<p>Similarly, spells are sometimes given in two columns. These should be given in just one column. Again I have manually tried to make this correct in the OCR software, but please verify this in the text.

<p>Have Fun!
